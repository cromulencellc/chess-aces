cvs (2:1.12.13+real-23) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this version, environment variables that are
  defined but empty are handled the same as undefined ones,
  except CVSREAD and CVSREADONLYFS (whose mere presence in
  the environment enables the functionality).

cvs (2:1.12.13+real-22) unstable; urgency=low

  Newly created repositories (from “cvs init”) now rely on
  CVSUMASK for the permissions of the “history” and “val-tags”
  files instead of creating them as world-writable.

  Newly created repositories contain a LogHistory configuration
  setting to only record write operations in the “history” file.

  If you are used to the previous behaviour, you can restore it
  by altering (or removing, in which case the (commented-out)
  default of logging everything will be used) the LogHistory
  configuration setting and changing the permissions on the
  “history” and “val-tags” files so that every user can write
  into them.

  If you did not deliberately open your repository to all users
  on your system, you might wish to change all existing repos
  to this behaviour. To do this, check out the CVSROOT module,
  edit the “config” file adding “LogHistory=TMAR”, check that
  change in, release the CVSROOT module, and chmod the “history”
  and “val-tags” files to either 0664 (if all users in the same
  group should be able to commit) or 0644 (if only you wish to
  commit), possibly 0660 or 0600 is non-committers should also
  be denied reading.

  Contact me (mirabilos) in #cvs on irc.freenode.net if you have
  any questions about this change or require further support.

cvs (2:1.12.13+real-7) unstable; urgency=high

  rcs2log no longer lives in the PATH, the contributed script
  and its manpage are in /usr/share/cvs/contrib/rcs2log now.

  Some contrib files (and their documentation) are no longer
  shipped with the binary package (antique, insecure, useless).

  -rHEAD in "cvs diff" now, consistently with all other cvs
  subcommands, means "tip of the trunk (MAIN branch)"; to
  access the tip of the another branch, use its name; as a
  compatibility aid, -r.bhead (only in diff) points to the
  tip of the sticky branch.

cvs (2:1.12.13+real-5) unstable; urgency=low

  This cvs package is a totally new packaging and has almost
  nothing in common with what was in Debian before. The most
  visible changes are outlined below:

  pserver is no longer officially supported; the cvs package
  does not install any service, inetd, or something similar.
  If you want to set up a CVS server, use SSH, as shown in:
  * http://www.stremler.net/Code/cvs_tricks/cvs-over-ssh.html
  * http://www.stremler.net/Code/cvs_tricks/cvs-over-ssh-advanced.html
  * http://www.stremler.net/Code/cvs_tricks/cvs-over-ssh-advanced2.html

  Consequentially, PAM is also no longer supported, and this
  package does not set up or manage any repositories; that's
  the system administrator's job now.

  For running "cvs admin" tasks the user must be a member of
  the new "_cvsadmin" system group, or the repository be set
  up (UserAdminOptions in CVSROOT/config) to allow everyone.

  The date format for $Id$ and similar in checkouts has been
  switched back from ISO 8601 to the standard RCS format, to
  keep checksums over checkouts/exports consistent. This, as
  well as the fact that only the :local: and :extssh: access
  methods are officially supported, is not negotiable.

  Please direct feature requests upstream, not to the BTS. I
  do quite an amount of hacking CVS, but prefer to care only
  about the packaging bits with "full power" in Debian.
