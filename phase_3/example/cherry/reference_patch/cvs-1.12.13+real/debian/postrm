# This maintainer script can be called the following ways:
#
# * postrm "remove"
# * postrm "purge"
# * old-postrm "upgrade" $new_version
# * disappearers-postrm "disappear" $overwriter $o_version
# The package's files have been removed or replaced; only Essential pak-
# kages may be available; skip gracefully actions requiring Depends.
#
# * new-postrm "failed-upgrade" $old_version
# * new-postrm "failed-upgrade" $old_version $new_version # 1.18.5, stretch
# Called when 'old-postrm "upgrade"' fails; the new package is unpacked,
# Essential packages and Pre-Depends are available; the latter have been
# configured and never removed but may be Unpacked or Half-Configured.
#
# * new-postrm "abort-install" [$old_version]
# * new-postrm "abort-install" $old_version $new_version # 1.18.5, stretch
# * new-postrm "abort-upgrade" $old_version
# * new-postrm "abort-upgrade" $old_version $new_version # 1.18.5, stretch
# Called when preinst fails; package is not unpacked. Essential packages
# and (unpacked or Half-Configured) Pre-Depends are available.
