2005-09-01  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* README: Update bug-cvs email.

2005-03-16  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* filesubr.c (open_file): Remove this function.

2005-03-01  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* config.h: Remove obsolete timeb cruft.

2004-10-07  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

2004-04-04  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* filesubr.c (isabsolute): Remove this function.
	* config.h (ISABSOLUTE): Define.

2004-02-17  Derek Price <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* run.c (quote, run_setup):  Probably broke this, but not by much. 
	Initially changed the wrong file but left it there in case somebody
	wanted to finish.  Most likely only the run_add_arg function needs
	to be fiddled with - the quoting has changed.

2003-11-10  Mark D. Baushke  <mdb@cvshome.org>

	* filesubr.c (xresolvepath): New function.

2003-08-07  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	Automake's benefit.

2003-07-16  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* config.h (PROTOTYPES): Remove definition.
	* filesubr.c: s/PROTO//.
	* run.c: Ditto.

2002-05-28  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* config.h: Use standard PROTOTYPES symbol instead of non-standard
	USE_PROTOTYPES.
	(Patch from Alexey Mahotkin <alexm@hsys.msk.ru>.)

2002-03-21  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove unecessary dependence on $(srcdir) to
	fix the dist target.
	(distdir): Use new automake generated target (copied from src).

2003-03-19  Mark D. Baushke  <mdb@cvshome.org>

2002-12-19  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove reference to options.h.
	* options.h: Remove file and move relevant content...
	* config.h: ...here.

2002-12-06  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	to malloc with calls to xmalloc.
	* popen.c: Ditto.
	* pwd.c: Ditto.
	* run.c: Ditto.
	(Reported by Dan Peterson <dbpete@aol.com>.)

2002-09-24  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

	* options.h: Remove prototype of STDC exit().  Move prototype of
	getpass()...
	* config.h: here.

2002-08-24  Larry Jones  <lawrence.jones@eds.com>

	* options.h: Remove PATCH_PROGRAM.

2002-08-16  Derek Price  <derek@ximbiot.com>

2001-03-14  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* Makefile.in (installcheck): New target.

2001-02-14  Larry Jones  <larry.jones@sdrc.com>

	* Makefile.in: Remove references to rtag.c & rtag.obj.

2000-12-21  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added support for Automake targets

1999-02-26  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Make RELATIVE_REPOS the default, as in
	../src/options.h.in.
	Remove CVS_DIFFDATE; removed from CVS on 27 Jun 1996.

1998-12-29  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in: Use the getdate.c in ../lib rather than the one
	here.  I don't know whether it compiles with Watcom and/or IBM's
	compiler, but having a copy of getdate.c in this directory has
	proven to be unworkable (the version I am removing still had Y2K
	bugs which were fixed in lib/getdate.c, for example).
	* getdate.c: Removed.

1998-04-09  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (link_file): Remove; no longer used.

Tue Feb 17 02:31:15 1998  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

 	asked about the top-level directory.

Wed Dec 31 10:56:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h, filesubr.c (convert_file): Remove; no longer used
	(except for BROKEN_READWRITE_CONVERSION which doesn't apply).

Sat Dec 27 16:57:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h (HAVE_RCS5): Remove; no longer used.

	* config.h (LINES_CRLF_TERMINATED): Remove; no longer used.

	rationale.

Sun Aug 10 20:42:51 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* pwd.c, pwd.h: Remove $Header; we decided to get rid of these
	some time ago.

Wed Jul 30 19:15:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (os2_chdir): If ENODEV is not defined, return ENOENT.

	* README: Talk about srcdir, top_srcdir, and rule to generate
	"Makefile".

Mon Jun 16 13:49:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h, rcmd.h, rcmd.c: Add "copyright" notice.

Sun Jun  8 23:41:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h (HAVE_MKFIFO): Remove; not used anywhere.

Wed Apr 30 12:45:50 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* icc.compilation-errors: Removed; it was the error messages from
	trying to compile CVS on OS/2, way out of date.

Wed Mar 12 16:10:01 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h (HAVE_SETVBUF): Removed; no longer used.

Mon Feb 10 20:01:20 1997  Ullrich von Bassewitz <uz@musoftware.com>

	* filesubr.c: Add an OS/2 specific chdir function that will not
        only change the path but will also make the drive current that
        is given in the argument string.
        config.h: #define the macro CVS_CHDIR to os2_chdir so cvs will
        use the os2_chdir function instead of chdir.

Mon Feb 10 18:29:04 1997  Ullrich von Bassewitz <uz@musoftware.com>

	* config.h: Define VA_LIST_IS_ARRAY so that vasprintf will work
	correctly with the watcom compiler.

Sun Feb  9 20:17:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Most of the compiler warnings are gone.

1997-02-09  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* popen.h: Arguments to popen are const char * not char *.

Wed Jan 29 18:27:11 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h, config.h (GREP): Remove; no longer used.

Tue Jan 28 18:29:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Remove SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_LONG; no longer needed
	with lib/md5.c changes.

	* watcom.mak (OS2_OBJECTS): Remove strippath.

Wed Jan  1 22:50:31 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Reword comment for TMPDIR_DFLT to make it clear that
	this isn't specific to the pserver server.

Wed Dec 18 10:51:38 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Specify -Gd- not -Gd+.  The documentation
	says this causes a static link, although it hasn't yet been
	verified whether this option is sufficient to make the binary work
	on a system without the compiler's DLL.

Fri Dec  6 11:00:49 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* os2inc.h, watcom.mak: Add GPL notice.

1996-11-24  Ullrich von Bassewitz  <uz@wuschel.ibb.schwaben.com>

	Changes for Watcom C:
	* README: Describe watcom port.
	* config.h: Include stdio.h and errno.h.
	* config.h: If EACCES is not defined, define it to EACCESS.
	* filesubr.c: Use EACCES not EACCESS.
	* config.h [__WATCOMC__]: Define _setmode and _cwait.
	Don't define HAVE_DIRENT_H.  Don't declare getpid.  Don't
	define NEED_DECOY_PERMISSIONS.  Don't define R_OK and friends.
	* os2inc.h: New file; includes os2.h but protected against
	multiple inclusion.
	* config.h: Include os2inc.h before defining sleep.
	* filesubr.c, getpass.c, popen.c, run.c: Include os2inc.h rather than
	trying to go through the right contortions to include os2.h
	ourselves.
	* popen.c (popen) [__WATCOMC__]: Use _hdopen together with fdopen.
	(popenRW): Change pid from PID to int.
	* tcpip.h [__WATCOMC__]: Work around errno value conflict
	between the TCP/IP header and errno.h.
	* watcom.mak: New file.

Sat Nov 23 18:36:11 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Try to clarify status vis-a-vis client vs. local.

Tue Nov 19 17:21:52 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (OS2_SOURCES): Remove strippath.c
	(OS2_OBJECTS): Remove strippath.obj.
	* strippath.c: Removed.

Fri Nov  8 14:28:19 1996  Ullrich von Bassewitz  <uz@wuschel.ibb.schwaben.com>

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): Check for ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES from
	DosFindFirst instead of ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND; that is what the
	function actually returns.  Cope with the fact that DosFindFirst
	and DosFindNext return only the name of the file itself, not any
	directory names.

Fri Nov 08 11:46:50 1996  Jim Kingdon

	IBM ICC (OS/2) lint:
	* filesubr.c: Cast from const char * to char * before passing to
	various system functions.
	(xchmod): Print error message instead of trying to return ENOENT.
	(unlink_file): Only call xchmod if the file exists.

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Don't specify -Wpro; there is no way
	that we could prototype getopt, for example.
	Don't specify -Wuse.  The EDC0805 warning ("Automatic
	variable line_allocated is set but not referenced.") warns
	about unavoidable constructs like line_allocated in
	client.c (send_file_names).

Sat Oct 26 16:21:26 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* config.h (HAVE_TZSET): Add a #definition for this.

Tue Oct  8 12:37:35 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* options.h (HAD_RCS4): Remove; no longer used.

Thu Sep 26 14:15:55 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (mkdir_if_needed): mkdir only takes one
	argument on OS/2.

Wed Sep 25 14:31:51 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h (TMPDIR_DFLT): Change from c:\temp to c:\\temp.

Fri Aug 16 16:05:29 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs): new (empty) target

Mon Aug 12 22:59:40 1996  Jim Kingdon  (unknown@beezley)

	* filesubr.c (fncmp): Fix typo (n1 -> n2) which had caused the
	function to always return 0.

	* Makefile.in (COMMON_OBJECTS): Add buffer.obj.
	(COMMON_SOURCES): Add buffer.c.
	(zlib_srcdir,ZLIB_OBJECTS): Added.
	(cvs.exe): Also link with ZLIB_OBJECTS.

	(LIB_OBJECTS): Add valloc.obj.
	(COMMON_OBJECTS): Add zlib.obj.

Mon Aug 12 16:25:32 1996  Steffen Siebert <siebert@susan.logware.de>
                          and Jim Kingdon  (unknown@beezley)

	* Makefile.in (cvs.exe): Use subst so that we link with \
	and compile with / without needing to mess with SL.
	* README: Adjust accordingly.

Mon Jul 15 22:32:13 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Remove EXECUTE_PERMISSION_LOSES; it is no longer used
	anywhere (superceded by CHMOD_BROKEN).

Fri Jun  7 13:07:37 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Change INITIALIZE_SOCKET_SUBSYSTEM to
	SYSTEM_INITIALIZE to reflect change in ../src/main.c.

Tue May 14 13:38:51 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (cvs_temp_name): New function.

Tue May  7 10:50:13 MET DST 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): Real implementation (like
	Windows-NT) for expanding.

Thu Apr 25 09:28:10 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Add note about LF vs. CRLF in makefile.

Tue Apr 23 20:43:01 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

Wed Feb 28 11:08:06 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Remove AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT; no longer should be
	defined in options.h.

	* config.h: Remove C_ALLOCA, CRAY_STACKSEG_END, HAVE_ALLOCA,
	HAVE_ALLOCA_H, and STACK_DIRECTION to reflect alloca removal.

Mon Feb 19 00:35:24 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Makefile.in: deal with new objects `mkmodules' and `vasprintf'.

        * getpass.c (EchoOn, EchoOff): new funcs.
        (getpass): use above new funcs to avoid echoing the password to
        the screen.

Mon Feb 12 16:09:55 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* run.c (run_popen): Changed more Popen() to run_popen()

Mon Feb 12 03:33:27 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

	* run.c: Changed Popen() to run_popen() for the benefit of
	case-insensitive linkers (VMS) which confuse Popen() with popen()

Mon Feb 12 03:14:36 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * options.h (PATCH_PROGRAM): "cvspatch" (see comment).

Fri Feb  9 22:10:12 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Remove SYSTEM_COMMENT_TABLE.

Sun Jan 28 12:31:03 1996  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@beezley)

	* filesubr.c (unlink_file): Use xchmod, not chmod, to make the
	file read-write.
	(xchmod): Translate / to \ in file name.  If file doesn't exist,
	return ENOENT rather than passing it to attrib (which will print an
	error message).

Sun Jan 28 01:51:27 1996  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@beezley)

	* config.h: Fix unclosed comment.

Sun Jan 28 00:16:58 1996  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

Sat Jan 27 16:18:20 1996  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * config.h (CHMOD_BROKEN): define to 1.

        * filesubr.c (rename_file): rename() returns non-zero error codes,
        not necessarily negative.

Fri Jan 26 00:52:12 1996  unknown  (unknown@beezley)

	* filesubr.c (copy_file): Open the file we are writing, not 
	just the one we are reading, in binary mode.

Thu Jan 18 14:53:58 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (CFLAGS): Don't use +=.  This makefile must be
	portable because it is used on all platforms (e.g. for "make dist").

Thu Jan 11 12:04:42 1996  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* options.h: remove CVS_NOADMIN

Wed Jan 10 15:56:46 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * options.h, config.h: moved NO_SOCKET_TO_FD definition from
        options.h to config.h, which is where it belongs.

Tue Jan  9 16:43:15 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * run.c (sleep): commented out this definition.
        * config.h: #define sleep() in terms of DosSleep(), unless sleep()
        is defined already.  Normally it's defined in
        tcpip/include/utils.h, however on beezley that definition is
        commented out for some reason.
        Don't prototype sleep().

Tue Jan  9 16:22:35 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add cvs.exe and icc.in.

Tue Jan 09 16:43:59 1996  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* filesubr.c (link_file): New function (copied from
	../windows-NT/filesubr.c)

Fri Jan  5 17:03:09 1996  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.red-bean.com>

        * Makefile.in: "lib_dir", not "libdir", to avoid conflict with
        top-level Makefile.

Mon Jan  1 22:59:46 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Makefile is not in srcdir.

Sat Dec 23 23:08:43 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * README: adjust for below change.

        * Makefile.in (install-cvs): replaces `install', which must remain
        a dummy rule so it will work under Unix.

Wed Dec 20 15:18:06 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in: build scramble.obj.

Mon Dec 18 22:49:28 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Reverted all changes between Mon Dec 18 14:54:04 1995 and
        present, non-inclusive.

Mon Dec 18 21:59:07 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * getpass.c: removed -- getpass() lives in os2/login.c now.

        * cvslogin.c: filled in.

        * login.c: new file.

        * Makefile.in: moved login.c and login.obj from COMMON to OS2
        section.

        * cvslogin.c: added long explanatory comment.

Mon Dec 18 18:13:57 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): include cvslogin.c.

        * README: updated.

        * Makefile.in (cvslogin.exe): new rule.
        (install): new rule.
        (install_dir): new var.

        * cvslogin.c: new file.

Mon Dec 18 14:54:04 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * getpass.c (getpass): removed debugging garbage.

        * options.h (NO_SOCKET_TO_FD): fixed comment (Windows 95, not NT,
        has this problem).
        (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT): on by default.

        * porttcp.c (SockStrError): fixed typo.
        (IbmSockSend): `Buffer' arg is const void * again.
        (IbmSockRecv): `Buffer' arg is const void * again.

        * tcpip.h (send): move send/recv redef section farther down to
        avoid type conflicts with the real send() and recv().
        (IbmSockSend, IbmSockRecv): adjust prototype.

Mon Dec 18 12:31:22 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * tcpip.h: reformatted.
        (send, recv): redefine to IbmSockSend and IbmSockRecv.

        * porttcp.c: reformatted.

Mon Dec 18 04:59:52 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * tcpip.h (send, recv): don't define these to be anything else.

        * porttcp.c (IbmSockSend, IbmSockRecv): make `Buffer' argument
        char * instead of void *, to evade an over-eager compiler.

Sun Dec 17 21:16:17 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h (NO_SOCKET_TO_FD): define to 1.

Sat Dec 16 21:31:02 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * run.c: mark unimplemented routines more clearly.  Hopefully I'll
        get time to implement them soon.

Fri Dec 15 17:50:17 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * tcpip.h, porttcp.c: new files.

        * makefile.in: added new files (for the "cvs watch" and "cvs edit"
        commands just checked in by Jim Kingdon).

Thu Dec 14 12:18:20 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * config.h (RSH_NEEDS_BINARY_FLAG): define to 1.

        * run.c (filter_stream_through_program): die, rather than return
        -1, if spawn failed.

        * options.h (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT): leave unset by default.

Wed Dec 13 21:31:10 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * waitpid.c (waitpid): Don't deal specially with statusp after all.
        The problem lies elsewhere.

Wed Dec 13 20:58:12 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * waitpid.c (waitpid): oops, make sure there is storage for
        local_statusp.
        Don't assign to *statusp if statusp is NULL.

Wed Dec 13 19:52:08 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * waitpid.c (waitpid): be more careful about child's exit status,
        and about return status of this function.

Wed Dec 13 20:10:50 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * makefile.in (clean): pass /NOE to the linker, to avoid duplicate
	symbols when linking with setargv.obj.

Wed Dec 13 18:44:47 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (ARGVLIB): new lib, link with this so command-line
        wildcard expansion works.  No, I'm not making this up.

Tue Dec 12 20:43:56 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@floss.cyclic.com)

        * getpass.c (getpass): new file and function.

        * options.h: prototype getpass() for OS/2.

        * makefile.in: include new file getpass.c.

Tue Dec 12 19:21:05 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h (RCSBIN_DFLT): expand comment.
        (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT, AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT): replace obsolete 
        CVS_AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT and CVS_AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT.

Mon Dec 11 16:03:01 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* makefile.in: removed various and sundry cruft...

Mon Dec 11 15:57:03 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* Removed cvs.exe; we don't need to keep the binary in the
	repository, now that binary file handling has been tested.

Mon Dec 11 15:53:51 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* rcmd.c (init_sockets): use sock_init(), not SockInit().

Mon Dec 11 12:43:35 1995  Adam Glass  <adamg@microsoft.com>
        
	* config.h: Remove NEED_CALL_SOCKINIT macro in favor of the more
 	generic INITIALIZE_SOCKET_SUBSYSTEM.
  	* rcmd.c: Move old NEED_CALL_SOCKINIT code here and wrap it in a
 	function, i.e init_sockets()
        
Sat Dec 09 21:16:09 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* Added cvs.exe, mainly to test binary file handling.  Once we
	know it works, we can remove it.

Sat Dec 09 15:29:16 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* options.h (DIFF, GREP): don't expect autoconf to help us out.

Sat Dec 09 15:05:41 1995  Karl Fogel  (kfogel@beezley.cyclic.com)

	* makefile.in (libdir): Fixed.

	* options.h: define CVS_AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT and
	CVS_AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT, instead of CVS_LOGIN.

Thu Dec  7 14:49:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* filesubr.c (isaccessible): Rename from isaccessable.

Mon Dec  4 11:28:10 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): prefix all filenames with
	  ${srcdir}${PS}
	  (dist-dir): remove ${srcdir}${PS} (some files already had this
	  prefix, now all have it)

Fri Dec  1 14:29:44 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (srcdir, libdir, cvs_srcdir): use autoconf vars.
        (dist-dir): use above vars now that they are autoconf-friendly.
        (clean): same.

Thu Nov 30 18:09:50 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * waitpid.c (waitpid): if _cwait() returns -1, test errno.  If
        ECHILD, then just return pid, else return -1.  This is for OS/2,
        which doesn't have zombie processes, or any other way of
        remembering a child process after it exits, as far as I can tell.

        * run.c (close_on_exec): don't error, just silently do nothing.

        * Makefile.in: use src/client.c, not os2/client.c.

        * config.h (EXECUTE_PERMISSION_LOSES): define to 1 (see
        src/client.c for why).
        (START_RSH_WITH_POPEN_RW): define to 1 (see src/client.c).

Wed Nov 29 16:34:34 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (start_server): declare pipes[] as int, not FILE *.
        Kinda nice that it worked anyway, but scary.  Ugh.

Wed Nov 22 11:29:11 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * config.h (KFF_DEBUG): expand to nothing; we don't want to print
        out debugging messages in a production copy.

Tue Nov 21 17:36:16 1995  unknown  (unknown@beezley)

        * popen.c: #include <fcntl.h>.

Tue Nov 21 16:18:37 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * popen.h (popenRW): prototype popenRW()... why wasn't I doing
        this before?

        * client.c (start_server): set tofd and fromfd with popenRW, now
        that it handles int file descriptors.
        Log to a file if asked, now that we have
        filter_stream_through_program().

        * popen.c (popenRW): put int file descriptors into the `pipes'
        array, not FILE *'s.  We'll fdopen in start_server, just like
        the good old days.

Tue Nov 21 16:34:37 1995  unknown  (unknown@beezley)

        * run.c (filter_stream_through_program): defined for OS/2.

        * client.c (start_server): pass a char **argv to popenRW and get a
        pid in return (instead of a return code).

        * popen.c (popenRW): use a char **argv and spawnvp(), instead of a
        char *command and DosExecPgm().

Mon Nov 20 23:31:54 1995  unknown  (unknown@beezley)

        * filesubr.c (convert_file): pass (S_IREAD | S_IWRITE) to open();
        we need it if O_CREAT, and it won't hurt if not.

Sun Nov 19 13:43:02 1995  unknown  (unknown@beezley)

	* makefile.in (clean): remove obj files in src/ and lib/ dirs too.

Sun Nov 19 12:35:08 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (start_server): took out old debug statements.

        * dirent.c, dirent.h: took out ^M's.

Sat Nov 18 13:39:06 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (start_server): took out debug statements.

        * filesubr.c (make_directories): compare errno to EACCESS, not
        EEXIST, to see if the dir already exists.

        * client.c, filesubr.c: Use new macro `existence_error', instead
        of comparing errno to ENOENT directly.

        * popen.c (popenRW): fixed misleading comment.

        * client.c:
        (rsh_pid): no more need for this var; the handle-to-PID library in
        popen.c manages PID's for us now.
        (start_rsh_server): removed this func, since we don't use it -- we
        do use `rsh', but we call it directly from popenRW().
        (get_responses_and_close): removed cruft that doesn't apply to
        this port -- i.e., blocks conditional on HAVE_KERBEROS or
        RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT.
        (start_server): Just check return code, instead of recording
        rsh_pid.

Fri Nov 17 21:13:22 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c (call_in_directory): Ask EACCESS even though we're
        looking for EEXIST.  That's just The Way Things Are Done here,
        apparently.  Ick.

        * getdate.c: took out some cruft that the more portable versions
        need.

        * Makefile.in: use getdate.c from os2/ subdir, not lib/.
        We don't use startserver.c anymore, so don't build it.

        * client.c (change_mode): never set anything executable, until we
        understand what that means in OS/2.

        * config.h (NEED_DECOY_PERMISSIONS): define to 1 (& see
        system.h).

Fri Nov 17 15:02:05 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c: fixed up more error codes.

        * client.c: (send_repository): take into account the cornucopia of
        error codes so generously offered by OS/2.

Fri Nov 17 14:53:22 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * client.c, client.h: new files, copied from ../src/.

        * config.h (HAVE_POPEN_RW): don't define this anymore, since we'll
        just be using our own version of client.c.

        * Makefile.in: reflect the fact that os2/client.c is now used
        instead of src/client.c.

Thu Nov 16 21:47:22 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

	* startserver.c: removed.  We don't need this anymore.

        * config.h (RSH_NOT_TRANSPARENT): undef this.  We have a
        transparent rsh.
        (HAVE_POPEN_RW): define to 1.

        * popen.c (popenRW): open writing and reading streams in binary
        mode (i.e., "wb" and "rb").

        * Makefile.in (clean): use `rm' not `del' to remove files.

Wed Nov 15 15:21:53 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * config.h: don't prototype gethostname() here anymore.
        (USE_OWN_TCPIP_H): define to 1.
        (NEED_CALL_SOCKINIT): define to 1.
        (KFF_DEBUG): debugging macro.

Tue Nov 14 12:20:22 1995  Greg A. Woods  <woods@most.weird.com>

	* .cvsignore: "Makefile" generated by ../configure

Mon Nov 13 13:21:43 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (PS): note to maintainers about this var.

Mon Nov 13 07:28:04 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * README: updated.

        * rcmd.c: #include <stdio.h>.

        * Makefile.in: Include lib/regex, lib/getdate, strippath.
        (PS): default to "/", since we always "make dist" on Unix
        systems.
        Ahem, "save-cwd" with a hyphen, not an underscore.  Oops.

        * strippath.c: new file.

        * popen.c: set DIAGNOSTIC off.  Reformat for readability.

        * popen.h: new file.

        * config.h (USE_OWN_POPEN): define to 1.

        * run.c (Popen): make this work now that we have popen().

Mon Nov 13 01:23:27 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in:
	(cvs.exe): broke up OBJECTS into components to create icc.in in
        more steps.  OBJECTS had gotten so big that it formed too long a
        command line all by itself.  Sheesh.
        Include stripslash (see below), lib/save_cwd, lib/sighandle,
        lib/yesno, startserver (see below), rcmd (see below), lib/xgetwd,
        lib/md5, waitpid (see below), lib/fnmatch, popen (see below).

        * popen.c, rcmd.c, rcmd.h, startserver.c, stripslash.c, waitpid.c:
        New files.

        * run.c (close_on_exec): new func (skeleton).
        (sleep): new func (OS/2 doesn't seem to have this).

        * pwd.c (getlogin): Don't call win32getlogin(), obviously.

        * config.h (W_OK, R_OK, X_OK, F_OK): define masks for access().
        Include <process.h> for getpid().

        * filesubr.c (isaccessable): define.  Don't know why I left it out
        before.  For that matter, I don't know how the Windows NT port
        gets along without it.  Hmmm.

Sat Nov 11 15:00:01 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in: Use backslashes in pathnames, so ICC doesn't
        mistake them for options.

        * run.c (run_setup): cleared away Windows NT stuff, left skeleton
        functions that just complain and die for now.
        (run_exec): correctly check return of spawn under OS/2; return
        child's exit status.
        (run_args): declare as returning void, in agreement with cvs.h.

Fri Nov 10 14:21:14 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (COMMON_SOURCES, COMMON_OBJECTS): removed filesubr
        and run, since we have OS/2-specific versions of them now.
        (DISTFILES): Include Makefile in distribution, since people won't
        be running configure on their OS/2 systems.
        (LIB_SOURCES, LIB_OBJECTS): new vars; we'll just build stuff in
        the lib directory and link it in directly.
        Made rules for compiling objects and for the full executable.
        (SHELL): got rid of this var, no need for it here.
        Use a pattern rule for obj files.
        Some other minor tweaks for OS/2.

        * threads.c: new file.

Wed Nov  8 11:14:46 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * run.c: include <stdarg.h> and <stdio.h>.
        Change all VA_START to va_start.
        Don't ask HAVE_VPRINTF -- this is an OS/2-specific file and we can
        take things for granted.
        Started simplifying old NT `HANDLE' code.

        * Makefile.in (OS2_SOURCES): added run.c.

        * run.c: new file, copied from ../windows-NT/run.c.  Started
        making changes for OS/2.

        * test-makefile (all): don't bother to echo $CFLAGS; we can just
        read the compilation command.

        * filesubr.c (unlink_file): make this work on OS/2.
        (unlink_file_dir): don't ask if errno == EISDIR.  We ain't
        got EISDIR in OS/2.
        (deep_remove_dir): use EACCESS to determine if directory
        nonempty.  We ain't got ENOTEMPTY in OS/2.
        (that_swing): removed references.  We ain't got that_swing in
        OS/2.
        (rename_file): just use unlink_file(); move to after definition of
        unlink_file() so we don't have to deal with IBM C/C++'s strange
        prototyping rituals.
        (link_file): removed this function -- no one uses it anymore.
        It still exists in src/filesubr.c, though.
        (OS2_filename_classes): new table (well, old table, new name).
        All references changed.

        * config.h (HAVE_SYS_UTIME_H): define to 1.

        * options.h: undef SETXID_SUPPORT, to correspond with Norbert
        Kiesel's recent change to ../src/options.h.in, etc.

Mon Nov  6 16:29:00 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * test-makefile (CFLAGS): -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -- this turns out to be
        important for stuff in lib/.
        Other trivial changes.

        * config.h (HAVE_DIRENT_H): define to 1, now that we have our own
        dirent.h and dirent.c.

        * Makefile.in (OS2_SOURCES): added filesubr.c; this may not be
        permanent.

Sun Nov  5 16:17:33 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (OS2_HEADERS, OS2_SOURCES): added dirent.h and
        dirent.c, respectively.

        * dirent.c, dirent.h: new files.

Sat Oct 28 14:41:38 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): include `test-makefile'.

        * test-makefile: new file; to be removed when the port is done.

Fri Oct 27 13:03:28 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (OS2_HEADERS, OS2_SOURCES): adjust as necessary for
        below changes.

        * config.h: oops, don't forget second argument, MODE.

        * mkdir.c (os2_mkdir): new file, new function.
        Can probably be merged with wnt_mkdir at some point.

        * config.h (ALLOCA_IN_STDLIB): new #define.

        * pwd.h, pwd.c: new files (for now, copied from ../windows-NT
        directory.  We'll modify/merge them as necessary.)

        * config.h: don't use __stdcall in declaration of gethostname().

        * Makefile.in (DISTFILES): include config.h and options.h.

Wed Oct 25 12:52:54 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * config.h: new file; will maintain by hand.
        Made first pass through to cast it into OS/2-ish condition.

        * Makefile.in: started adding lots of OS/2 gunk.
        Took out autoconf stuff; just don't want to fool around with that
        until after it compiles on beezley.
        (cvs.exe): moved this rule to bottom.

Tue Oct 24 13:51:05 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in: add autoconf variables

	* Makefile.in (dist): use $(srcdir)

Mon Oct 23 17:37:36 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (clean): new rule.

        * init os2 directory.  Made dummy Makefile.in, README.
