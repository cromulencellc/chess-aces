hite like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with
whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.

This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the
tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,
to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged
tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded
bear or shark.[5]

 [5] With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
 who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
 whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
 hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
 it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that the
 irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
 fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing
 together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear
 frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this
 to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have
 that intensified terror.
    As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in
    that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies
    with the same quality in the Polar qua
