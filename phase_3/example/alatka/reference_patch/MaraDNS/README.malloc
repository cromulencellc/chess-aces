MaraDNS terminates upon a malloc() failure. Deadwood's behavior 
is undefined should malloc() fail. If anyone is using MaraDNS in an
environment where a kernel allows malloc() to return a NULL pointer, it is
best to wrap MaraDNS in a script that restarts it when it terminates. If
using Deadwood in an environment where malloc() may return NULL, please
replace the dw_malloc() macro with a function that can properly handle
a malloc() failure.
