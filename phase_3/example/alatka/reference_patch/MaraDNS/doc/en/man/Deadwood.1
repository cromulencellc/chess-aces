.PP
.SH "COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS"
.PP
Deadwood has a single optional command line argument: The location
of the configuration file that Deadwood uses specified with the "-f"
flag.
If this is not defined, Deadwood uses the file "/etc/dwood3rc" as the
configuration file.
.PP
In other words, invoking Deadwood as
.B "Deadwood"
will cause Deadwood to
use /etc/dwood3rc as the configuration file; invoking Deadwood as
.B "Deadwood -f foobar"
will cause Deadwood to use the file "foobar"
in the current working directory (the directory one is in when
starting Deadwood) as the configuration file.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The Deadwood configuration file supports the following parameters:
.PP
.in -3
\fBbind_address\fR
.PP
This is the IP (or possibly IPv6) address we bind to.
.PP
.in -3
\fBcache_file\fR
.PP
This is the filename of the file used for reading and
writing the cache to disk; this string can have lowercase letters,
the \(aq-\(aq symbol, the \(aq_\(aq symbol, and the \(aq/\(aq symbol
(for putting
the cache in a subdirectory). All other symbols become a \(aq_\(aq
symbol.
.PP
.in -3
\fBchroot_dir\fR
.PP
This is the directory the program will run from.
.PP
.in -3
\fBdeliver_all\fR
.PP
Some upstream DNS servers violate the RFCs and send "name error"
DNS packets without a SOA record in the NS section of the reply.
Deadwood used to discard such packets; Deadwood now passes such
packets on to the client without caching them.
.PP
Should the old behavior of discarding these packets is desired,
set this to 0 with "deliver_all=0" in the dwood3rc file.
.PP
The default value for this is 1
.PP
.in -3
\fBdns_port\fR
.PP
This is the port Deadwood binds to and listens on for
incoming connections. The default value for this is the standard DNS
port:
port 53
.PP
.in -3
\fBfilter_rfc1918\fR
.PP
When this is set to 1, RFC1918 (private) IP addresses are not allowed
to be
in DNS replies. See http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/ for why this
improves
security.
.PP
The default value for this is 1
.PP
.in -3
\fBhandle_noreply\fR
.PP
When this is set to 0, Deadwood sends no reply
back to the client (when the client is a TCP client, Deadwood closes
the
TCP connection) when a UDP query is sent upstream and the upstream DNS
never sends a reply.
.PP
When this is set to 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER FAIL
back to the client when a UDP query is sent upstream and the upstream
DNS
never sends a reply.
.PP
The default value for this is 1
.PP
.in -3
\fBhandle_overload\fR
.PP
When this has a value of 0, Deadwood sends no reply when a UDP query is
sent and the server is overloaded (has too many pending connections);
when it has a value of 1, Deadwood sends a SERVER FAIL packet back to
the sender of the UDP query. The default value for this is 1.
.PP
.in -3
\fBhash_magic_number\fR
.PP
This is a large 31-bit prime number that the hash compression function
uses; use the RandomPrime C program to generate a suitable random prime
for this function. This number should be secret; its default value
changes for every release of Deadwood.
.PP
.in -3
\fBip_blacklist\fR
.PP
This is a list of IPs that we do not allow to be in the answer to a
DNS request. The reason for this is to counteract the practice some
ISPs have of converting a "this site does not exist" DNS answer in to
a page controlled by the ISP; this results in possible security issues.
.PP
This parameter only accepts individual IPs, and does not use netmasks.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaradns_uid\fR
.PP
The user-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any number
between 10 and 65535; the default value is 99 (nobody on
RedHat-derived Linux distributions). This value is not
used on Windows systems.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaradns_gid\fR
.PP
The group-id Deadwood runs as. This can be any
number between 10 and 65535; the default value is 99. This
value is not used on Windows systems.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_ar_chain\fR
.PP
Whether resource record rotation is enabled. This this has a value
of 1, resource record rotation is enabled, otherwise resource record
rotation is disabled.
.PP
Resource record rotation is usually desirable, since it allows DNS to
act like a crude load balancer. However, on heavily loaded systems it
may be desirable to disable to disbale it to reduce CPU usage.
.PP
The reason for the unusual name for this variable is to retain
compatibility
with MaraDNS mararc files.
.PP
The default value is 1: Resource record rotation enabled.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_inflights\fR
.PP
The maximum number of simultanious clients we process at the same
time for the same query.
.PP
If, while processone a query for, say, "example.com.", another
DNS client sends to Deadwood another query for example.com, instead
of creating a new query to process example.com, Deadwood will
attach the new client to the same query that is already "in flight",
and
send a reply to both clients once we have an answer for example.com.
.PP
This is the number of simultaneous clients a given query can have. If
this
limit is exceeded, subsequents clients with the same query are refused
until
an answer is found. If this has a value of 1, we do not merge multiple
requests for the same query, but give each request its own connection.
.PP
The default value is 8.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaximum_cache_elements\fR
.PP
The maximum number of elements our cache
is allowed to have. This is a number between 32 and 16,777,216;
the default value for this is 1024. Note that, if writing the
cache to disk or reading the cache from disk, higher values of
this will slow down cache reading/writing.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmaxprocs\fR
.PP
This is the maximum number of pending remote UDP connections
Deadwood can have. The default value for this is 32.
.PP
.in -3
\fBmax_tcp_procs\fR
.PP
This is the number of allowed open TCP connections. Default value: 8
.PP
.in -3
\fBnum_retries\fR
.PP
The number of times we retry to send a query upstream
before giving up. If this is 0, we only try once; if this is 1,
we try twice, and so on, up to 8 retries. Note that each retry
takes timeout_seconds seconds before we retry again. Default
value: 2
.PP
.in -3
\fBns_glueless_type\fR
.PP
The RR type we send to resolve glueless records. This should be
1 (A) when mainly using IPv4 to resolve records. If glueless NS records
have AAAA but not A records, and IPv6 is enabled, it may make sense to
give this a value of 255 (ANY). If IPv4 ever stops being used on a
large
scale, it may eventually become possible to make this have a value of
28 (AAAA).
.PP
The default value is 1: An A (IPv4 IP) record.
.PP
.in -3
\fBrandom_seed_file\fR
.PP
This is a file that contains random numbers, and
is used as a seed for the cryptographically strong random number
generator.
Deadwood will try to read 256 bytes from this file (the RNG Deadwood
uses can
accept a stream of any arbitrary length).
.PP
.in -3
\fBrecurse_min_bind_port\fR
.PP
The lowest numbered port Deadwood is
allowed to bind to; this is a random port number used for the source
port of outgoing queries, and is not 53 (see dns_port above). This
is a number between 1025 and 32767, and has a default value of 15000.
This is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more difficult.
.PP
.in -3
\fBrecurse_number_ports\fR
.PP
The number of ports Deadwood binds to for the source port for
outgoing connections; this is a power of 2 between 256 and 32768.
This is used to make DNS spoofing attacks more difficult. The default
value is 4096.
.PP
.in -3
\fBrecursive_acl\fR
.PP
This is a list of who is allowed to use the
load balancer, in "ip/mask" format. Mask must be a number between
0 and 32 (for IPv6, between 0 and 128). For example, "127.0.0.1/8"
allows local connections.
.PP
.in -3
\fBreject_aaaa\fR
.PP
If this has a value of 1, a bogus SOA "not there" reply is sent
whenever
an AAAA query is sent to Deadwood. In other words, every time a program
asks
Deadwood for an IPv6 IP address, instead of trying to process the
request,
when this is set to 1, Deadwood pretends the host name in question does
not
have an IPv6 address.
.PP
This is useful for people who aren\(aqt using IPv6 but use applications
(usually
*NIX command like applications like "telnet") which slow things down
trying
to find an IPv6 address.
.PP
This has a default value of 0. In other words, AAAA queries are
processed
normally unless this is set.
.PP
.in -3
\fBresurrections\fR
.PP
If this is set to 1, Deadwood will try to send an
expired record to the user before giving up. If it is 0, we
don\(aqt. Default value: 1
.PP
.in -3
\fBroot_servers\fR
.PP
This is a list of root servers; its syntax is identical to
upstream_servers (see below). This is the type of DNS service
ICANN, for example, runs. These are servers used that do
not give us complete answers to DNS questions, but merely tell
us which DNS servers to connect to to get an answer closer to
our desired answer.
.PP
.in -3
\fBtcp_listen\fR
.PP
In order to enable DNS-over-TCP, this variable must be set and have
a value of 1. Default value: 0
.PP
.in -3
\fBtimeout_seconds\fR
.PP
This is how long Deadwood will wait before giving
up and discarding a pending UDP DNS reply.
The default value for this is 2, as in 2 seconds.
.PP
.in -3
\fBtimeout_seconds_tcp\fR
.PP
How long to wait on an idle TCP connection before
dropping it. The default value for this is 4, as in 4 seconds.
.PP
.in -3
\fBttl_age\fR
.PP
Whether TTL aging is enabled; whether entries in the cache have their
TTLs set to be the amount of time the entries have left in the cache.
.PP
If this has a value of 1, TTL entries are aged. Otherwise, they are
not.
The default value for this is 1.
.PP
.in -3
\fBupstream_port\fR
.PP
This is the port Deadwood uses to connect or send packets to the
upstream server. The default value for this is 53; the standard
DNS port.
.PP
.in -3
\fBupstream_servers\fR
.PP
This is a list of DNS servers that the load balancer will try to
contact.
This is a
.I "dictionary variable"
(array indexed by a string instead of
by a number) instead of a simple variable. Since upstream_servers
is a dictionary variable, it needs to be initialized before being used.
.PP
Deadwood will look at the name of the host that it is trying to find
the upstream server for, and will match against the longest suffix it
can find.
.PP
For example, if someone sends a query for "www.foo.example.com" to
Deadwood, Deadwood will first see if there is an upstream_servers
variable for "www.foo.example.com.", then look for "foo.example.com.",
then look for "example.com.", then "com.", and finally ".".
.PP
Here is an example of upstream_servers:

.nf
upstream_servers = {} # Initialize dictionary variable
upstream_servers["foo.example.com."] = "192.168.42.1"
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.99.254"
upstream_servers["."] = "10.1.2.3, 10.1.2.4"
.fi

In this example, anything ending in "foo.example.com" is resolved
by the DNS server at 192.168.42.1; anything else ending in
"example.com"
is resolved by 192.168.99.254; and anything not ending in "example.com"
is resolved by either 10.1.2.3 or 10.1.2.4.
.PP
.B "Important:"
the domain name upstream_servers points to must end in
a "." character. This is OK:

.nf
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.42.1"
.fi

But this is
.B "not"
OK:

.nf
upstream_servers["example.com"] = "192.168.42.1"
.fi

The reason for this is because BIND engages in unexpected behavior
when a host name deoesn\(aqt end in a dot, and by forcing a dot at the
end
of a hostname, Deadwood doesn\(aqt have to guess whether the user wants
BIND\(aqs behavior or the "normal" behavior.
.PP
If neither root_servers nor upstream_servers are set, Deadwood sets
root_servers to use the default ICANN root servers, as follows:
.PP

.nf
198.41.0.4      a.root-servers.net (VeriSign) 
192.228.79.201  b.root-servers.net (ISI) 
192.33.4.12     c.root-servers.net (Cogent) 
128.8.10.90     d.root-servers.net (UMaryland) 
192.203.230.10  e.root-servers.net (NASA Ames) 
192.5.5.241     f.root-servers.net (ISC) 
192.112.36.4    g.root-servers.net (DOD NIC) 
128.63.2.53     h.root-servers.net (ArmyRU) 
192.36.148.17   i.root-servers.net (NORDUnet) 
192.58.128.30   j.root-servers.net (VeriSign) 
193.0.14.129    k.root-servers.net (Reseaux) 
199.7.83.42     l.root-servers.net (IANA)
202.12.27.33    m.root-servers.net (WIDE) 
.fi

This list is current as of May 3, 2010, and was last changed on
November 1, 2007.
.PP
.in -3
\fBverbose_level\fR
.PP
This determines how many messages are logged on standard output; larger
values log more messages. The default value for this is 3.
.SH "ip/mask format of IPs"
.PP
Deadwood uses both standard ip/netmask formats to specify IPs.
An ip is in dotted-decimal format, e.g. "10.1.2.3" (or in ipv6
format when ipv6 support is compiled in).
.PP
The netmask is used to specify a range of IPs.
The netmask can be in one of two formats: A single number between
1 and 32 (128 when ipv6 support is compiled in), which indicates the
number of leading "1" bits in the netmask, or a 4-digit
dotted-decimal netmask.
.PP
.B "10.1.1.1/24"
indicates that any ip from 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.255
will match.
.PP
.B "10.1.1.1/255.255.255.0"
is identical to 10.1.1.1/24
.PP
.B "10.2.3.4/16"
indicates that any ip from 10.2.0.0 to 10.2.255.255
will match.
.PP
.B "10.2.3.4/255.255.0.0"
is identical to 10.2.3.4/16
.PP
.B "127.0.0.0/8"
indicates that any ip with "127" as the first
octet (number) will match.
.PP
.B "127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0"
is identical to 127.0.0.0/8
.PP
The netmask is optional, and, if not present, indicates that only
a single IP will match.
.SH "DNS over TCP"
.PP
Deadwood has support for both DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP; the same
daemon listens on both the UDP and TCP DNS port. DNS-over-TCP must
be explicitly enabled by setting tcp_listen to 1.
.PP
Only UDP DNS queries are cached. Deadwood does not support caching
over TCP; it handles TCP to resolve the occasional truncated reply or
handle the occasional non-RFC-compliant TCP-only DNS resolver.
.SH "Parsing other files"
.PP
It is possible to have Deadwood, while parsing the dwood3rc file, read
other files and parse them as if they were dwood3rc files.
.PP
This is done using
.BR "execfile" "."
To use execfile, place a line like
this in the dwood3rc file:
.PP
execfile("path/to/filename")
.PP
Where path/to/filename is the path to the file to be parsed like a
dwood3rc file.
.PP
All files must be in or under the directory /etc/deadwood/execfile.
Filenames can only have lower-case letters and the underscore
character ("_"). Absolute paths are not allowed as the argument to
execfile; the filename can not start with a slash ("/") character.
.PP
If there is a parse error in the file pointed to by execfile, Deadwood
will report the error as being on the line with the execfile command in
the main dwood3rc file. To find where a parse error is in the sub-file,
use something like "Deadwood -f /etc/deadwood/execfile/filename"
to find the parse error in the offending file, where "filename" is the
file
to to parsed via execfile.
.SH "IPV6 support"
.PP
This server can also be optionally compiled to have IPv6 support. In
order
to enable IPv6 support, add \(aq-DIPV6\(aq to the compile-time flags.
For
example, to compile this to make a small binary, and to have ipv6
support:

.nf
	export FLAGS=\(aq-Os -DIPV6\(aq
	make
.fi

.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
Deadwood is a program written with security in mind.
.PP
In addition to use a buffer-overflow resistant string library and a
coding
style and SQA process that checks for buffer overflows and memory
leaks,
Deadwood uses a strong pseudo-random number generator (The 32-bit
version
of Radio Gatun) to generate both the query ID and source port. For the
random number generator to be secure, Deadwood needs a good source of
entropy; by default Deadwood will use /dev/urandom to get this entropy.
If you are on a system without /dev/urandom support, it is important
to make sure that Deadwood has a good source of entropy so that the
query
ID and source port are hard to guess (otherwise it is possible to forge
DNS packets).
.PP
Note that Deadwood is not protected from someone on the same network
viewing
packets sent by Deadwood and sending forged packets as a reply.
.PP
To protect Deadwood from certain possible denial-of-service attacks, it
is
best if Deadwood\(aqs prime number used for hashing elements in the
cache is
a random 31-bit prime number. The program RandomPrime.c generates a
random prime that is placed in the file DwRandPrime.h that is
regenerated
whenever either the program is compiled or things are cleaned up with
make clean. This program uses /dev/urandom for its entropy; the file
DwRandPrime.h will not be regenerated on systems without /dev/urandom.
.PP
On systems without direct /dev/urandom support, it is suggested to see
if
there is a possible way to give the system a working /dev/urandom. This
way, when Deadwood is compiled, the hash magic number will be suitably
random.
.PP
If using a precompiled binary of Deadwood, or if using a system where
it is
not feasible to add /dev/urandom support, one can use another system to
generate a 31-bit random prime (perhaps using a different system with
/dev/urandom support), then use the hash_magic_number parameter to have
Deadwood use this random prime number.
.SH "DAEMONIZATION"
.PP
Deadwood does not have any built-in daemonization facilities; this is
handled by the external program Duende or any other daemonizer.
.SH "Example configuration file"
.PP
Here is an example dwood3rc configuration file:

.nf
# This is an example deadwood rc file 
# Note that comments are started by the hash symbol

bind_address="127.0.0.1" # IP we bind to

# The following line is disabled by being commented out
#bind_address="::1" # We have optional IPv6 support

# Directory we run program from (not used in Win32)
chroot_dir = "/etc/deadwood" 

# The following upstream DNS servers are Google\(aqs 
# newly-announced (as of December 2009) public DNS

# http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/
#
# These IPs can be changed to the IPs of any recursive 
# DNS servers that can be reached from the computer 
# running Deadwood, such as your ISP\(aqs DNS servers.
upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["."]="8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4" 

# Who is allowed to use the cache.  This line
# allows anyone with "127.0" as the first two

recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16" 

# Maximum number of pending requests
maxprocs = 8 

# Send SERVER FAIL when overloaded
handle_overload = 1 

maradns_uid = 99 # UID Deadwood runs as

maximum_cache_elements = 60000

# If you want to read and write the cache from disk, 
# make sure chroot_dir above is readable and writable 
# by the maradns_uid/gid above, and uncomment the 
# following line
#cache_file = "dw_cache"

# If your upstream DNS server converts "not there" DNS replies
# in to IPs, this parameter allows Deadwood to convert any reply
# with a given IP back in to a "not there" IP.  If any of the IPs
# listed below are in a DNS answer, Deadwood converts the answer
# in to a "not there"
#ip_blacklist = "10.222.33.44, 10.222.3.55"
.fi

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
DNS-over-TCP needs to be explicitly enabled. Note that DNS-over-TCP is
almost never used. Also,
Deadwood does not cache DNS packets larger than 512 bytes in size that
need to be sent using TCP. In addition, DNS-over-TCP packets which
are "incomplete" DNS replies (replies which a stub resolver can not
use,
namely either a NS referral or an incomplete CNAME reply) are not
handled correctly by Deadwood. Again, DNS-over-TCP is very rare.
.PP
Deadwood can not process DNS resource record types with numbers between
65392 and 65407. These RR types are marked by the IANA for "private
use";
Deadwood reserves these record types for internal use. This is only 16
record types out of the 65536 possible DNS record types (only 71 have
actually been assigned by IANA, so this is a non-issue in the real
world).
.PP
It is not clear whether the DNS RFCs allow ASCII control characters
in DNS names. Even if they were, Deadwood does not allow ASCII
control characters (bytes with a value less then 32) in DNS names.
Other characters (UTF-8, etc.) are allowed.
