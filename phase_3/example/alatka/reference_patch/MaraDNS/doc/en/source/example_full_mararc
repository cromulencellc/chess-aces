# synthesizing, a special DNS query ("erre-con-erre-cigarro.maradns.org." 
# with a TXT query returns the version of MaraDNS that a server is 
# running), unique handling of multiple QDCOUNTs, etc.  Some people 
# might not like these features, so I have added a switch that lets 
# a sys admin disable all these features.  Just give "no_fingerprint" 
# a value of one here, and MaraDNS should be more or less 
# indistinguishable from a tinydns server.
