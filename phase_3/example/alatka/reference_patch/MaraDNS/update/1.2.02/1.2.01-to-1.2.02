# To run this script, make sure that this script is in the directory
# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.2.00 to 1.2.01, make sure 
# maradns-1.2.00.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.00*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma on your system to run this script

# Get the current and next version number

echo applying patches

# Patch #1: Update the compile-time flags

# Patch #2: Get rid of all of the compile-time warning now visible
# because of the new compile flags
patch -p1 < update/1.2.02/maradns-1.2.01-no_warnings.patch

# Patch #3: Update the build process for cygwin; remove compile warnings
patch -p1 < update/1.2.02/maradns-1.2.01-cygwin.patch

# Patch #4: Add a new mararc variable, bind_star_handling, for people
# who wish MaraDNS to act more like BIND when handing star records
patch -p1 < update/1.2.02/maradns-1.2.01-bind_star_handling.patch

# Patch #5: Update convert.ej to note existance of bind_star_handling;
#           add year 2006 to copyright template; update SOURCE.FILES
patch -p1 < update/1.2.02/maradns-1.2.01-doc.patch

# Patch #6: Update configure to compile on unknown platforms after the
#           user sees obnoxious unsupported message (instead of telling
#	    the user they need to port MaraDNS and refusing to compile)
#	    Also: Warn FreeBSD and Darwin (Mac OS X) users that Mara
#	    hasn't been fully tested on this platform
patch -p1 < update/1.2.02/maradns-1.2.01-configure.patch

# Patch #7: Update COPYING file for 2006
