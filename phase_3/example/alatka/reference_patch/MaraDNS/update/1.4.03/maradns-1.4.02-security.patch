 Impact: Remote denial of service.
+
+<li>
+A bug introduced in MaraDNS 1.3.03 (January 2007): Hostnames that 
+incorrectly not end with a dot result in a string being deallocated then used.  
+
+<p>
+MaraDNS 1.2 does not have this issue.
+<p>
+
+This issue can <b>not</b> be exploited from zones loaded using DNS's zone
+transfer mechanism; fetchzone filters data obtained this way.  This issue
+can <b>only</b> be exploited in the unusual case of an attacker having control
+of the contents of a csv2 zone file to be parsed by MaraDNS.  
+<p>
+
+This issue, on Linux systems, results in a null pointer dereference that 
+terminates that MaraDNS process.
+
+<p>
+
+This issue was fixed in MaraDNS 1.4.03 and 1.3.07.10, released February 2, 
+2010.

+Impact: Denial of service.
