+- Security fix: There was a theoretical issue with the cryptographic
+  code in Deadwood, where a standards-compliant compiler might not
+  generate correct secure random numbers (used for the query ID and 
+  query source port).  I can not find a compiler which actually
+  generates insecure code (I tested against gcc 4.8.5, gcc 7.3.0, clang
+  3.4.2, and clang 5.0.1), but in the interest of caution, I am making
+  a security update, and have added tests to make sure this bug does
+  not manifest itself when run against multiple compilers and compile
+  flags (it's only an issue with -O2 and -O3 in clang using a different
+  implementation of RadioGatun[32]).
