Between 2005 and early 2020, MaraDNS was updated by a shell script which
would run a bunch of patches against the code to make a new release.

Between 2010 and early 2020, Deadwood was updated using similar shell
scripts.

This allowed me to track changes without having to use a revision control
system.  In 2014, I started using Git to make some of the changes, but I
did not transition to making stable releases directly from Git until 2020.

This directory has the full history of Deadwood changes done using 
this system.
