# Release-specific fixes and changes go here

# Patch #1: Update dwood2rc_n_timeout_seconds to work around CentOS bug
#		#4465 reported at http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=4465

rm sqa/dwood2rc_n_timeout_seconds/output.test

# Patch #2: Get packets too big to fit in dns-over-udp to work when running
#	Deadwood as a recursive nameserver
patch -p1 < update/2.9.03/deadwood-2.9.02-truncated_packet_recursive.patch

# Patch #3: Allow IP-based-ACL thingys without an explicit netmask (No,
# 	I was not the one to break this behavior)
patch -p1 < update/2.9.03/deadwood-2.9.02-no_ip_netmask.patch

# Patch #4: Fix a comment (no code) in DwRecurse.c that discusses why 173
#	is a magic constant used
patch -p1 < update/2.9.03/deadwood-2.9.02-173_comment_fix.patch

# Patch #5: Tweak the timeout for resolving child queries (instead of 
# timeout*4, let's try timeout*16)
patch -p1 < update/2.9.03/deadwood-2.9.02-timeout_tweak.patch

# Patch #6: Hide via #ifdef unused functions from Deadwood to make it smaller;
# these are functions I use while debugging Deadwood but are not used
# in the end-user program; also make an alias for printf() that is
# only defined if the debuggins stuff (XTRA_STUFF) is enabled (to stop
# releasing Deadwood with debug data being logged)
