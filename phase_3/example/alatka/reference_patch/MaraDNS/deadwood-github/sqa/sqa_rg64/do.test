# Since there was a bug in another rg32 implementation which only showed 
# up with "clang -O2" and "clang -O3" (it passed with all gcc and tcc 
# options), we have a test to make sure rg64 works with all compilers 
# and all flags

# This is not used to verify the actual RG64 code, but to summarize
# that we got the right answers
