This test makes sure that TCP works on the real internet (where buffering 
is used, unlike over the loopback interface).  This test works by
using the real server for www.example.com as the upstream server, and
making a query to that server.

Note that this test will need to be revised if the real server for 
www.example.com changes or the data for www.example.com changes.
That in mind, this test is done first because it will fail every
time the server/data for www.example.com changes but this test
isn't updated to reflect those changes.
