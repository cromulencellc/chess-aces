One way to get Deadwood to work in Windows 10 is to use a cmd 
prompt with administrator privileges.

==Getting an admin cmd prompt==

To open up an admin cmd prompt:

* Go to the start menu and search for "cmd"

* When found, right click on it and run "cmd" as an administrator

==Installing Deadwood as an administrator==

Once this administrative "cmd" prompt is opened, it is necessary to
install Deadwood:

* At the cmd prompt, use the "cd" command to find and enter the directory
  where Deadwood is unpacked (where this file is located)

* Invoke the "install.bat" script from this directory (by simply typing in
  "install.bat" without the quotes)

* Once Deadwood is installed, it is important not to change the directory
  where Deadwood is locted; otherwise the service manager may have problems
  finding the Deadwood service.

==Troubleshooting Deadwood==

Note that, should there be an issue which causes Deadwood to not start,
no error messages will be visible in Windows 10.  To view any errors
when starting up Deadwood, it may be necessary to invoke Deadwood as
the non-Administrator as follows from this directory:

	Deadwood.exe --nodaemon dwood3rc.txt

If there are no issues starting up Deadwood, the process will hang and need
to be terminated with the task manager.  If there are issues starting
up Deadwood, the process will quickly terminate and a logfile with the
relevant information will be in this file:

	dwlog.txt
