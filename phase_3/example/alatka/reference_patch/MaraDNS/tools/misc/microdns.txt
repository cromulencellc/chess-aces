MicroDNS

This is a "one-trick pony" DNS server. This compact and simple DNS server
does only one thing: Always return the same IP for any query sent to the
DNS server. This IP is given as the first argument to the program. The
second, optional, argument specifies the IP the server has; if not given,
the DNS server will attempt to bind to all IPs the server running this
program has.

For example, to have the program always give the IP 172.16.72.129 to
any query, and listen on the IP 127.0.0.1, invoke the program thusly:

     microdns 172.16.72.129 127.0.0.1
