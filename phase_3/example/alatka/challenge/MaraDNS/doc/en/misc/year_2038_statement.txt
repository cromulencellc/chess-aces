MaraDNS has added, in the 1.1 branch, full support for 64-bit timestamps.
On machines with a 32-bit timestamp, MaraDNS is smart enough to convert 
the 32-bit timestamp in to a 64-bit timestamp, which pushes the rollover 
date in to the future.

On 32-bit systems, MaraDNS will work fine until at least 2106 (Mara should 
work fine until 2115.) if the time stamp rolls over (if dates after
January 19, 2038 are shown as dates in the early 1900s).  Note that while
Windows XP Posix 32-bit timestamps roll over to the early 1900s, Windows
10 Posix 32-bit timestamps instead return an error after January 19, 2038.

While a 32-bit compile, the Deadwood Windows port uses Windows 
64-bit timestamps to get the time.  

The Windows 32-bit compile of MaraDNS will no longer fully function
come January 19, 2038.  This compile stopped being supported in
2020; instead, Windows users who want authoritative MaraDNS are directed
to use Cygwin to compile MaraDNS.
