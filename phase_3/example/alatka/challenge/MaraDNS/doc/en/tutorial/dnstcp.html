<h1>DNS over TCP</h1>

MaraDNS has full support for DNS over TCP.  However, this setup is
not automatically done; a little configuration needs to be set up and the
"zoneserver" daemon has to be running in addition to the MaraDNS daemon
in order for DNS records to be served over TCP.

<p>

The first mararc variable that needs to be set is <tt>tcp_convert_acl</tt>.
This is a list of IPs that are allowed to make DNS-over-TCP queries.  In
the case of using MaraDNS as an authoritative nameserver, this should
have a value of "0.0.0.0/0" (anyone on the internet can make TCP
DNS connections).  

<p>

The second mararc variable that needs to be set is 
<tt>tcp_convert_server</tt>.  This is the IP of the UDP DNS server that we
will connect whenever we get a DNS-over-TCP request.  The way we perform
DNS over TCP is as follows:

<ul>
<li>The resolver or end user connects via TCP to the <tt>zoneserver</tt> 
    daemon.
<li>The resolver sends a DNS query over TCP.
<li>The <tt>zoneserver</tt> program converts the query in to a UDP query.
<li><tt>zoneserver</tt> sends the UDP query to the ip specified in the
    <tt>tcp_convert_server</tt> mararc variable.
<li><tt>zoneserver</tt> waits for a UDP reply
<li>After <tt>zoneserver</tt> gets a UDP reply, it converts this reply to
    a TCP reply to give to the resolver/end user.
</ul>

<p>

This is what a mararc file which serves the domain <tt>example.com</tt>
and will provide both DNS over UDP and TCP will look like:

<pre>
ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.2.3"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
csv2 = {}
csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
tcp_convert_acl = "0.0.0.0/0"
tcp_convert_server = "10.1.2.3"
</pre>

With this mararc file, and the csv2 zone file "db.example.com" in the
directory <tt>/etc/maradns</tt>, the program <tt>maradns</tt> will process
UDP DNS queries, and <tt>zoneserver</tt> will process TCP DNS queries.  
<tt>maradns</tt> is a standalone UDP DNS server; <tt>zoneserver</tt> is a
TCP proxy that converts TCP requests in to UDP requests.  Both daemons
must be running to process both UDP and TCP DNS queries.

<p>

<hr>

<h2>Long packets</h2>

<tt>maradns</tt>, the UDP DNS server, in compliance with RFC1035
section 2.3.4, will not output a packet longer than 512 bytes long.
This is sufficient packet size for well over 99% of the DNS traffic out there.

<p>

However, some DNS packets may need to be longer than this.  MaraDNS has
support for outputting DNS packets up to 4096 bytes long.  RFC1035 only
allows such packets to be sent over TCP; the work around is to have the
UDP server only send long RFC-violating DNS packets to the TCP server;
which then converts the long UDP packet in to a RFC-compliant long TCP
packet.

<p>

One uses the <tt>long_packet_ipv4</tt> mararc variable to
tell <tt>maradns</tt> which IPs we will send long UDP packets to.
This value is usually the same value as is set for 
<tt>ipv4_bind_addresses</tt>.

<p>

<tt>long_packet_ipv4</tt> is a list of IPs <tt>maradns</tt> will send
RFC-violating long UDP packets to.  When <tt>zoneserver</tt> listens for
a UDP reply from <tt>maradns</tt>, the <tt>zoneserver</tt> program will
be able to process long UDP packets, converting them in to
RFC-compliant TCP DNS packets.

<p>

This is what a <tt>mararc</tt> file which provides authoritative DNS over
TCP and UDP, sending long UDP packets to the TCP server to process,
will look like:

<pre>
ipv4_bind_addresses = "10.1.2.3"
chroot_dir = "/etc/maradns"
csv2 = {}
csv2["example.com."] = "db.example.com"
tcp_convert_acl = "0.0.0.0/0"
tcp_convert_server = "10.1.2.3"
long_packet_ipv4 = "10.1.2.3"
</pre>

The <tt>zoneserver</tt> program can also be used to serve DNS
zones; see the file <A href=dnsmaster.html>dnsmaster</A> for
details.
