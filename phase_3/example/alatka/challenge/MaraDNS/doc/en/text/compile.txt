                    Compiling MaraDNS and Deadwood

Requirements

   MaraDNS is supported on two platforms: CentOS Linux 5, and
   Windows XP (via MinGW32).

   Other systems can be easily ported to, but are not supported.
   This means that, while it should be fairly easy to port MaraDNS
   to another platform, you will have to port it yourself or pay me
   to port it for you. The Windows XP port does not support all of
   the features the CentOS Linux version has.

Downloading, compiling, and installing MaraDNS

     * Obtain MaraDNS from www.maradns.org
     * Extract the MaraDNS tarball:

         bzip2 -cd maradns-*.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

     * Enter the directory that the above extraction generated.
     * Compile MaraDNS. Type in ./configure followed by make in the
       top-level MaraDNS directory.
     * Install the MaraDNS package. As root:

         make install

       This will install both the binaries and the man pages for
       'maradns', 'Deadwood' (MaraDNS 2.0's recursive DNS server),
       'askmara', 'duende', 'fetchzone', and 'zoneserver'. In
       addition, this will (if the files are not already present),
       install an example /etc/mararc, make the /etc/maradns
       directory, and place an example zone file (db.example.com)
       in /etc/maradns. Finally, this will place MaraDNS
       documentation in /usr/local/doc ; man pages will be placed
       in /usr/local/man or /usr/local/share/man.
