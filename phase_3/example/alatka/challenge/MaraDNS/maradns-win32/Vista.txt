One way to get Deadwood to work in Vista or Windows 7 is to use a cmd 
prompt with administrator privileges.

To open up an admin cmd prompt:

* Go to the start menu and search for "cmd"

* When found, right click on it and run "cmd" as an administrator

Once this administrative "cmd" prompt is opened, it is necessary to
install Deadwood:

* At the cmd prompt, use the "cd" command to find and enter the directory
  where Deadwood is unpacked (where this file is located)

* Invoke the "install.bat" script from this directory (by simply typing in
  "install.bat" without the quotes)

* Once Deadwood is installed, it is important not to change the directory
  where Deadwood is locted; otherwise the service manager may have problems
  finding the Deadwood service.
