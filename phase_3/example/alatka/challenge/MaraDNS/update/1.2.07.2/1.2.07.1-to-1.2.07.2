# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.2.02 to 1.2.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.2.02.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma on your system to run this script

# Get the current and next version number

echo applying patches

# Patch #1: Daniel Zilli pointed out that the location of Duende in the
#           zoneserver startup script was wrong
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.1-zoneserver_startup.patch

# Patch #2: Have the server return "server fail" instead of "format
#           error" when no nameservers could be contacted when trying
#           to recursively resolve a given host name
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.1-servfail.patch

# Patch #3: Make handle_noreply have a default value of 1 ("server fail")
#           instead of 2 ("this host does not exist"); this affects how
#           MaraDNS handles the case of being unable to contact any
#           host when recursively processing a query
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.1-handle_noreply.patch

# Patch: Update RPM spec file (this is always done)

# Add Daniel's wonderful Brazilian translation (I hear this language at work;
# it sounds like an eastern European language with Spanish vocabulary to my
# ears)
