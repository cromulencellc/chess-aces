-<H2>ANSWERS</H2>
-
-<a name="tryout"> </a>
-<H2>1. How to I try out MaraDNS?</H2>
-
-<p>Read the <A href="quickstart.html">quick start guide</A>, which
-   is the file named 0QuickStart in the MaraDNS distribution.
-<p>
-<a name="license"> </a>
-<H2>2. What license is MaraDNS released under?</H2>
-<p>None, actually.  MaraDNS is released to the public domain.
-
-<a name="ips"> </a>
-<H2>3. How do I get MaraDNS to bind to multiple IP addresses?</H2>
-<p>
-The current method is to run multiple copies of MaraDNS, each using its
-own mararc file.
-<p> 
-E.g:
-
-<blockquote>
-<pre>
-maradns -f /etc/mararc.1
-maradns -f /etc/mararc.2
-etc.
-</pre>
-</blockquote>
-<p>
-If you just want to bind to all IP addresses your computer has, bind to
-the IP "0.0.0.0"; however this can cause problems.  See the next 
-question.
-<p> 
-I don't think this will be too hard to correctly implement, since I
-already have code for specifying multiple IP addresses with the IP ACL
-code used by the zone server.  Until then, I will add this workaround to
-the FAQ.
-
-<a name="ipsbug"> </a>
-<H2>4. How come BIND 9 can not process MaraDNS queries when MaraDNS is bound
-to multiple IP addresses?</H2>
-In certain cricumstances, when MaraDNS is bound to more than one IP
-address, the underlying OS will send the UDP reply with a different IP
-than the IP the UDP query was sent to.  This will confuse BIND 9, since
-BIND 9's method for listening for requests that BIND has sent out expects
-the reply to come from the same IP that the request was sent to.
-<p>
-
-<a name="bugzilla"> </a>
-<H2>5. How do I report bugs in MaraDNS?</H2>
-
-<p>
-Before reporting a bug that MaraDNS has, please read the relevant man
-pages.  The man pages should be installed when one installs MaraDNS, and,
-in addition, are available in the <tt>doc/man</tt> directory of the
-MaraDNS source tarball.  (It is also possible that you are reading the man
-page right now)
-<p>
-
-Some MaraDNS man pages (namely, the man pages for <B>maradns</B>,
-<B>askmara</B>, <B>zoneserver</B>, and <B>mararc</B>) have a section,
-titled "BUGS", which list already known bugs which I feel are not
-important enough to fix before the 1.0 release of MaraDNS.  Bug reports
-which mention one of these bugs will be cheerfully ignored (or given a 
-polite "thanks for the report, in this man page the bug is already 
-mentioned" message if I am in a particularly good mood).
-
-<p>
-Subscribe to the mailing list by sending mail to 
-<A href="mailto:list-subscribe@maradns.org">list-subscribe@maradns.org</A>
-with "subscribe" as the subject line,
-and describe the bug by sending email to
-<A href="mailto:list@maradns.org">list@maradns.org</A>.
-
-<a name="chatter"> </a>
-<H2>6. Some of the postings to the mailing list do not talk about MaraDNS!</H2>
-In cases where I post something to the mailing list which does not directly
-talk about MaraDNS, the subject line will not have [MARA] in it, but will
-have some form of the word CHATTER in it.  
-<P>
-This way, people who do not like this can set up mail filters to filter out
-anything that comes from this list and doesn't have [MARA] in the subject
-line, or simply unsubscribe from the list and read the list from the
-archives; if one needs to report a bug, they can subscribe to the list
-again, post their bug, then unsubscribe after a week.  
-<P>
-Another option is to set up one's Freshmeat preferences to be notified
-in email every time I update MaraDNS at Freshmeat.  This will give one
-email notice of any critical bug fixes without needing to be
-subscribed to the mailing list.
-<P>
-The web page <A href="http://www.maradns.org">http://www.maradns.org/</A>
-has a link to the mailing list archives.
-
-<a name="unsub"> </a>
-<H2>7. How to I get off the mailing list?</H2>
-Send an email to list-request@maradns.org with "unsubscribe" as the
-subject line.
-
-<a name="rdns"> </a>
-<H2>8. How do I set up reverse DNS on MaraDNS?</H2>
-
-By using PTR (pointer) records.  For example, the PTR record which performs
-the reverse DNS lookup for the ip 1.2.3.4 looks like this in a CSV1 zone
-file:
-<blockquote>
-<tt>
-P4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.|86400|www.example.com.
-</tt>
-</blockquote>
-
-If you wish to have a PTR (reverse DNS lookup; getting a DNS name from a
-numeric IP) record work on the internet at large, it is not a simple
-matter of just adding a record like this to a MaraDNS zonefile.  One also
-needs control of the appropriate in-addr.arpa. domain.
-
-<p>
-
-While it can make logical sense to contact the IP 10.11.12.13 when trying
-to get the reverse DNS lookup (fully qualified domain name) for a given
-IP, DNS servers don't do this.  DNS server, instead, contact the root
-DNS servers for a given in-addr.arpa name to get the reverse DNS lookup,
-just like they do with any other record type.
-
-<p>
-
-When an internet service provider is given a block of IPs, they are also
-given control of the DNS zones which allow them to control reverse DNS
-lookups for those IPs.  While it is possible to obtain a domain and run
-a DNS server without the knowledge or intervention of an ISP, being
-able to control reverse DNS loookups for those IPs requires ISP 
-intervention.
-
-<a name="timeout"> </a>
-<H2>9. I am on a slow network, and MaraDNS can not process recursive 
-queries</H2>
-
-MaraDNS, by default, only waits two seconds for a reply from a remote
-DNS server.  This default can be increased by adding a line like this 
-in the mararc file:
-
-<blockquote>
-<pre>
-timeout_seconds = 5
-</pre>
-</blockquote>
-
-Note that making this too high will slow MaraDNS down when DNS servers
-are down, which is, alas, all too common on today's internet.
-
-<a name="obtuse"> </a>
-
-<H2>10. When I try to run MaraDNS, I get a 
-<tt>Fatal error: Error running populate_main program</tt>
-or a <tt>Fatal error: init_cache() failed</tt> error message.</H2>
-
-<p>If a line in a mararc file is too long, you will see, before the
-"Fatal error: Error running populate_main program" message, a message
-showing you the line number which is too long and the filename with
-the offending line.  While it is possible to increase this limit
-by changing the appropriate variable in the MaraDns.h file, the
-current limit is in line with the 512-byte limit that UDP DNS
-packets have; MaraDNS does not currently support DNS over TCP.
-
-<p>Otherwise, this error message should not be visible.  If it appears, 
-subscribe to
-the mailing list (see above), and describe your problem by sending email to 
-<A href="mailto:list@maradns.org">list@maradns.org</A>.  Be sure to include
-the following information:
-
-<ul><li>The contents of your /etc/mararc file
-
-<li>The contents of any files in /etc/maradns
-
-<li>The full output MaraDNS generates

-<a name="rrany"> </a>
-<H2>11. I am trying to register a domain under the .au or the .de name space,
-and my registrar is not taking my domain name</H2>
-
-<p>Both the German registrar and the Australian registrars require a RR_ANY
-request to return NS and SOA records.  MaraDNS can do this if you add the
-following line to your mararc file:<p>
-
-<tt>default_rrany_set = 15</tt>
-
-<a name="netstat"> </a>
-<H2>12. After I start MaraDNS, I can not see the process when I run netstat -na
-</H2>
-
-Udp services do not have a prominent "LISTEN" when netstat is run.
-<p>
-When MaraDNS is up, the relevant line in the netstat output looks 
-like this:            
-<tt>
-udp        0      0 127.0.0.4:53            0.0.0.0:* 
-</tt>
-<p>
-While on the topic of netstat, if you run <TT>netstat -nap</TT> as root,
-you can see the names of the processes which are providing internet 
-services.
-
-<a name="jsstr"> </a>
-<H2>13. What string library does MaraDNS use?</H2>
-
-<p>MaraDNS uses her own string library, which is called the "js_string"
-library.  Man pages for most of the functions in the js_string library
-are in the folder <tt>doc/man</tt> of the <A href="download.html">MaraDNS
-distribution</A>
-
-<a name="license"> </a>
-<H2>14. Why is MaraDNS public domain instead of BSD or GPL licensed?</H2>
-
-<p>The post-1.0.xx releases of MaraDNS are, in fact, under a simple
-   BSD license (without any "obnoxious" advertising clause).
-<p>I used a public domain (non-)license so that MaraDNS could be integrated 
-   with Python without trouble.  While
-Python is, I believe, currently GPL compatible, Python was not 
-GPL-compatible at the time I decided on a license for MaraDNS.
-
-<a name="thythreads"> </a>
-<H2>15. Why does MaraDNS use a multi-threaded model?</H2>
-
-<p>The multi-threaded model is, plain and simple, the simplest way to write
-a functioning recursive DNS server.  There is a reason why MaraDNS, pdnsd, and
-BIND 9 all use the multi-threaded model.
-
-<a name="wishlist"> </a>
-<H2>16. I feel that XXX feature should be added to MaraDNS</H2>
-<p>
-Before sending mail to the list with a feature request, please read
-the UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES section of the MaraDNS man page, which has a
-list of feature requests other people have already sent me.  If you do not 
-see your requested feature in this section of the man page, send an email to

-UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURES section of the MaraDNS man page.

-Feature requests which include a patch which implements the feature in 
-question are may even be implemented by MaraDNS, as long as the patch comes
-with a declaration that the patch is public domain.
-<p>
-Note that MaraDNS is currently "frozen".  In other words, new features will
-not be added until after the 1.0 release.
-
-<a name="docbook"> </a>
-<H2>17. I feel that MaraDNS should use another documentation format</H2>
-<p>
-The reason that MaraDNS uses its own documentation format is to satisfy both
-the needs of translators to have a unified document format and my own 
-need to use a documentation format that is simple enough to be readily
-understood and which I can add features on an 
-as needed basis.
-<p>
-The documentation format is essentially simplified HTML with some
-special tags added to meet MaraDNS' special needs.
-<p>
-For people who prefer other formats of documentation, I am open to
-making filters which convert from MaraDNS' own "EJ" documentation format
-to the format in question after MaraDNS 1.0 is released.
-<p>
-Having a given program have its own documentation format is not
-without precedent; Perl uses its own "pod" documentation format.
-
-<a name="patch"> </a>
-<H2>18. Is there any process I need to follow to add a patch to MaraDNS?</H2>
-
-<p>Yes.  
-
-<p>Here is the procedure for making a proper patch:
-
-<p>
-
-<ul>
-<li>Enter the directory that the file is in, for example
-    <tt>maradns-0.9.20/server</tt>
-
-<li>Copy over the file that you wish to modify to another file
-    name.  For example: <tt>cp MaraDNS.c MaraDNS.c.orig</tt>
-
-<li>Edit the file in question, e.g: <tt>vi MaraDNS.c</tt>
-
-<li>After editing, do something like this: <br><tt>
-    diff -u MaraDNS.c.orig MaraDNS.c > maradns.patch</tt>
-
-<li>Make sure the modified version compiles cleanly
-
-</ul>
-
-Send a patch to me in email, along with a statement that you place
-the contents of the patch in to the public domain.  If I find that the patch
-works well, I will integrate it in to MaraDNS.
-
-<a name="primary"> </a>
-<H2>19. Can MaraDNS act as a primary nameserver?</H2>
-
-<p>Yes.
-
-<p>The <tt>zoneserver</tt> program serves zones so that other DNS servers
-can be secondaries for zones which MaraDNS serves.  This is a separate
-program from the <tt>maradns</tt> server, which processes both 
-authoritative and recursive UDP DNS queries.
-
-<a name="secondary"> </a>
-<H2>20. Can MaraDNS act as a secondary nameserver?</H2>
-
-<p>Yes.
-
-<p>The 'getzone' program obtains zone files from remote DNS servers, 
-   outputting the contents of the zone file in MaraDNS' "csv1" zone
-   file format.  This program can be run from cron.  If one desires 
-   more BIND-like functionality, getzone can be wrapped in a
-   shell script that uses askmara to look at the SOA record to see if 
-   the serial number of the zone has changed.
-
-<p>I feel that the traditional DNS design of having a single application
-   both serve DNS records and handle the maintenance of zone files is
-   not ideal; the best design is to have a number of simple applications
-   working together.
-
-<a name="auth"> </a>
-<H2>21. What is the difference between an authoritative and a recursive DNS 
-server?</H2>
-
-A recursive DNS server is a DNS server that is able to contact other DNS
-servers in order to resolve a given domain name label.  This is the kind 
-of DNS server one points to in /etc/resolve.conf
-
-<p>
-
-An authoritative DNS server is a DNS server that a recursive server 
-contacts in order to find out the answer to a given DNS query.
-
-<a name="bailiwick"> </a>
-<H2>22. The getzone client isn't allowing me to add certain hostnames to 
-my zone</H2>
-
-For security reasons, MaraDNS' getzone client does not
-add records which are not part of the zone in question.  For example,
-if someone has a zone for example.com, and this record in the zone:
-
-<p>
-<tt>
-P1.1.1.10.in-addr.arpa.|86400|dns.example.com.
-</tt>
-<p>
-MaraDNS will not add the record, since the record is out-of-bailiwick.  In
-other words, it is a host name that does not end in .example.com.  
-<p>
-There are two workarounds for this issue:
-<UL>
-<LI>Create a zone file for 1.1.10.in-addr.arpa., and put the PTR records
-    there.
-<LI>Use rcp, rsync, or another method to copy over the zone files in 
-    question.
-</UL>
-
-<a name="kosherzone"> </a>
-<H2>23. I have having problems transferring zones from MaraDNS' zone server
-      to a BIND zone transfer client</H2>
-
-<p>BIND is rather picky about what kind of data it will accept from
-a zone server.  Make sure the following is true with your domain:
-<ul>
-<li>Make sure that the authoritative NS records are at the top of your 
-    zone, immediately after the SOA record
-<li>Make sure that your authoritative NS records are NS records
-    for your zone
-<li>To work around <A href="quirks.html">a known bug in MaraDNS</a>, make
-    sure you have at least one non-NS record between the authoritative NS
-    records for your zone and any delegation NS records that exist in the
-    zone.
-</ul>
-<p>
-Here is an example bad zone file (with a linefeed added to the SOA
-line):

-<H2>24. Is MaraDNS portable?</H2>
-
-<p>While I intend to have MaraDNS be a portable DNS server which will
-compile on a variety of unices, right now all of MaraDNS's work development
-is being done on Linux.  
-In terms of proprietary OSes, I know that SCO Open Server,
-SCO UNIXware and <A href="solaris.html">Solaris</A> have issues running a
-UDP or TCP server in a chroot() environment.  Word is that, with
-Solaris and UNIXware, placing /dev/tcp and /dev/udp in the chroot() jail
-will allow a server like MaraDNS to function.
-
-<a name="openbsd"> </a>
-<H2>25. How do I compile MaraDNS on OpenBSD?</H2>
-
-<p>
-There are two ways to do this:
-
-<P>
-To use the native thread support add -pthread to the CFLAGS variable.
-<P>
-To use the GNU pthread library, install the pth package and add
--L/usr/local/lib/pth to the linker.
-<P>
-(Florin Iucha provided this tip)
-
-<a name="cygwin"> </a>
-<H2>26. Can I use MaraDNS in Windows?</H2>
-
-<p>
-Yes.
-
-<p>
-Provided, of course, that one has the Cygwin environment which emulates
-a UNIX environment in Windows.
-
-<p>
-MaraDNS should now compile fine on Cygwin systems. If not, join the mailing
-list and let me know; I will correct this FAQ entry.

-<H2>27. MaraDNS freezes up after being used for a while</H2>
-
-If using your ISP's name servers or some other name servers which
-are not, in fact, root name servers, please make sure that you are
-using the upstream_servers dictionary variable instead of the
-root_servers dictionary variable.
-
-<p>
-
-If you still see MaraDNS freeze up after making this correction, please
-send a bug report to the mailing list.
-
-<a name="python"> </a>
-<H2>28. What kind of Python integration does MaraDNS have</H2>
-
-The mararc file uses the same syntax that Python uses; in fact, Python
-can parse a properly formatted mararc file.
-<p>
-There is currently no other integration with Python.
-
-<a name="kvar"> </a>
-<H2>29. Doesn't "kvar" mean "four" in Esperanto?</H2>
-
-Indeed, it does.  However the use of "kvar" in the MaraDNS source
-code only coincidentally is an Esperanto word.  "kvar" is short
-for "Kiwi variable"; a lot of the parsing code comes from the code
-used in the Kiwi spam filter project.  
-
-<a name="timestamp"> </a>
-<H2>30. How do I make MaraDNS' time stamps human-readable?</H2>
-
-MaraDNS uses standard UNIX timestamps; which is the number of 
-seconds since Midnight, January 1, 1970.
-<p>
-To make MaraDNS' time stamps human readable, use this awk script:
-
-<pre>
-maradns -f /etc/maradns | awk '
-          /Timestamp/{
-           gsub(/Timestamp: ([0-9]+)/,
-                strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S",$2),$0)}
-          {print}' >> logfile
-</pre>
-
-The MaraDNS startup script has the option to use this Awk script 
-to convert the time stamp; read the script for details.
-
-<a name="scability"> </a>
-<H2>31. How scalable is MaraDNS?</H2>
-
-MaraDNS is optimized for serving a small number of domains as quickly
-as possible.  That said, MaraDNS is remarkably efficnent for serving a
-large number of domains, as long as the server MaraDNS is on has the
-memory to fit all of the domains, and as long as the startup time for
-loading a large number of domains can be worked around.
-<P>
-The "big-O" or "theta" growth rates for various MaraDNS functions
-are as follows, where N is the number of authoritative host names being
-served:
-<p>
-<pre>
-Startup time				N
-Memory usage				N
-Processing incoming DNS requests	1
-</pre>
-<p>
-As can be seen, MaraDNS will process 1 or 100000 domains in the same amount
-of time, once the domain names are loaded in to memory.

-<H2>I'm getting a warning about dangling CNAME entries</H2>
-
-Let us suppose we have a CNAME record without an A record in the local
-DNS server's database, such as:
-
-<pre>
-	Cgoogle.example.com.|86400|www.google.com.
-</pre>
-
-<p>
-This record, which is a CNAME record for "google.example.com", points
-to "www.google.com".  Some DNS servers will recursively look up 
-www.google.com, and render the above record like this:
-
-<pre>
-	Cgoogle.example.com.|86400|www.google.com.
-	Awww.google.com.|900|66.102.7.104
-</pre>
-
-<p>
-
-For security reasons, MaraDNS doesn't do this.  Instead, MaraDNS will simply
-output:
-
-<pre>
-	Cgoogle.example.com.|86400|www.google.com.
-</pre>
-
-Some stub resolvers will be unable to resolve google.example.com as
-a consequence.
-

 <h2>31. I have a NS delegation, and MaraDNS is doing

-In the case of there being a NS delegation, MaraDNS handles recursive

-you use <tt>askmara</tt> with the <tt>-n</tt> option, dig with the 
-<tt>+norecuse</tt> option, or <tt>nslookup</tt> with the <tt>-norec</tt>
-option, MaraDNS will try to recursively resolve the record that is

-
-<p>
-
-The thinking is this: A normal recursive DNS query is usually one 
-where one wants to know the final DNS output.  So, if MaraDNS
-delegates a given record to another DNS server, and gets a recursive
-request for said query, MaraDNS will recursively resolve the query
-for you.
-

-will try to contact 10.1.2.4 to resolve www.joe.example.com.
-
-<p>
