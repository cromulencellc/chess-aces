# containing the tarball for the version of MaraDNS you wish to update, and
# all of the patches are in a directory entitled 'patches'.

# For example, to update MaraDNS 1.2.02 to 1.2.03, make sure 
# maradns-1.2.02.tar.lzma is in the same directory as this script, and
# that the directory containing this script has a directory called
# "patches/" which has all of the maradns-1.2.02*.patch files.

# You will need to have lzma on your system to run this script

# Get the current and next version number

# Patch #1: Adam Montague was kind enough to provide an OpenBSD account
#           for me to test MaraDNS with OpenBSD on.  This patch allows
#           MaraDNS to compile on OpenBSD

# Patch #2: Update the webpage to point out that 1.2 was released a little
#           while ago
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.2-webpage.patch

# Patch #3: Update mqhash to allow the password for a given site to be
#           changed more than three times
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.2-mqhash.patch

# Patch #4: Slight revision to mqhash
patch -p1 < update/$NEXT/maradns-1.2.07.2-mqhash_2.patch

# Patch #5: Clarify that a single name can have multiple IPs
