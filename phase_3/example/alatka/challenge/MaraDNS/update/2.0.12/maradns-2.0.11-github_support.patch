 A note for Debian users
 
-   First of all, I would like to point out that I really appreciate
-   Debian making a MaraDNS package available. This package has
-   increased the number of MaraDNS users, and the Debian developers
-   have given me feedback that has improved MaraDNS.
-
-   However, because of Debian's policies, their "Stable" version of
-   MaraDNS is usually an outdated version of MaraDNS that contains
-   bugs that I have since fixed. I do not support these outdated
-   versions of MaraDNS, and request that Debian users upgrade to
-   the current stable version of MaraDNS before sending the mailing
-   list bug reports or asking for technical support. Here is my
-   guide for Debian users, telling them how to upgrade the outdated
-   version of MaraDNS Debian comes with:
-
-     * MaraDNS 1.4 is a "bugfix only" branch, and no new features
-       have been added to this version of MaraDNS.
-
-     * Updating from previous versions of MaraDNS up to MaraDNS 1.4
-       is trivial and fully documented
-
-     * It is very easy to update the buggy version of MaraDNS that
-       the Debian package comes with an updated MaraDNS.
-
-     * First, download the most recent stable version of MaraDNS
-       from the MaraDNS download page or from the Sourceforge
-       page.
-
-     * Next, unpack the MaraDNS tarball. For example, if you
-       downloaded the file "maradns-1.4.01.tar.bz2" (please only
-       download MaraDNS-1.4.01 if it is the current stable version,
-       which it is at time of writing this document), type in this
-       command:
-
-         tar xvjf maradns-1.4.01.tar.bz2
-
-     * Enter the maradns-1.4.version directory, where version is
-       the bugfix revision number of the most current 1.4 release
-       of MaraDNS.
-
-     * Compile MaraDNS 1.4version with the following commands:
-
-         ./configure; make
+   It looks like the Debian MaraDNS package is being put on
+   the back burner (it's only in "unstable" and was pulled from "testing")
+   because of lack of maintenance. People who wish to continue using
+   MaraDNS really should get it here or at
+   https://github.com/Samboy/MaraDNS/
+
+   Debian’s “Stable” version of MaraDNS is usually an outdated version of
+   MaraDNS that contains bugs that I have since fixed, or introduces new
+   bugs. I do not support the Debian package for MaraDNS, and request that
+   Debian users upgrade to the current stable version of MaraDNS before
+   asking for technical support.
+
+   If using a 1.x version of MaraDNS, please read the update guide.
+     * First, download the most recent stable version of MaraDNS from the
+       MaraDNS download page or from the Sourceforge page.
+     * Next, unpack the MaraDNS tarball. For example, if you downloaded
+       the file "maradns-2.0.11.tar.bz2" (please only download
+       MaraDNS-2.0.11 if it is the current stable version, which it is at
+       time of writing this document), type in this command:
+
+     tar xvjf maradns-2.0.11.tar.bz2
+     * Enter the maradns-2.0.version directory, where version is the
+       bugfix revision number of the most current 2.0 release of MaraDNS.
+     * Compile MaraDNS 2.0.version with the following commands:
 
+     ./configure; make
      * If the above fails, you may need to install the "gcc" and
        "libc6-dev" packages before being able to compile programs:
 
-         sudo apt-get install gcc
-         sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
-
-     * Once MaraDNS is compiled, make sure to stop the MaraDNS
-       daemon:
-
-         /etc/init.d/maradns stop
-
-     * Now, replace the outdated MaraDNS program that comes with
-       Debian. From the maradns-1.4.version directory, type in the
-       following command:
-
-         sudo cp server/maradns /usr/sbin/
+     sudo apt-get install gcc
+     sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
+     * Once MaraDNS is compiled, make sure to stop the MaraDNS daemon:
+
+     /etc/init.d/maradns stop
+     * Now, replace the outdated MaraDNS program that comes with Debian.
+       From the maradns-2.0.version directory, type in the following
+       command:
 
+     sudo cp server/maradns /usr/sbin/
      * Restart the MaraDNS daemon:
 
-         /etc/init.d/maradns start
-
-   At this point, your MaraDNS daemon is now the fully supported
-   version of MaraDNS. If you continue to have the bug or concern
-   after upgrading to the latest 1.4 release, please let us know on
-   the mailing list so we can begin to resolve the issue.
+     /etc/init.d/maradns start

+   to the latest 2.0 release, please let us know on the support forum so
+   we can begin to resolve the issue.
