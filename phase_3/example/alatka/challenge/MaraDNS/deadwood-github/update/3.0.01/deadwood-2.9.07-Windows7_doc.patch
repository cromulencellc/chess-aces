+One way to get Deadwood to work in Vista or Windows 7 is to use a cmd 
+prompt with administrator privileges.
 
-   To create a cmd prompt with admin rights:
+To open up an admin cmd prompt:
 
-     * Right click on an unused part of the desktop
+* Go to the start menu and search for "cmd"
 
-     * Select the "new" sub-menu
+* When found, right click on it and run "cmd" as an administrator
 
-     * Select "shortcut" in this sub-menu
+Once this administrative "cmd" prompt is opened, it is necessary to
+install Deadwood:
 
-     * When it asks for the location of the new shortcut, just type in "cmd"
-       (without the quotes)
+* At the cmd prompt, use the "cd" command to find and enter the directory
+  where Deadwood is unpacked (where this file is located)
 
-     * Click on "next"
+* Invoke the "install.bat" script from this directory (by simply typing in
+  "install.bat" without the quotes)
 
-     * When it asks for a name for the shortcut, the name "cmd" is fine;
-       click on "finish"
-
-     * There will now be a shortcut on your desktop with the name "cmd".
-       Right click on this shortcut.
-
-     * Select "properties", and make sure the tab selected at the top of the
-       "properties" window is the "shortcut" tab
-
-     * Click on the "advanced" button
-
-     * Check the "execute as administrator" checkbox
-
-     * Click OK in this window and (if needed) in the "properties" window
-
-   At this point, you will have a shortcut with the name "cmd" that is akin
-   to the "su" command in *NIX: Clicking on this shortcut will give you a
-   command prompt with full access to the system. Note that the UAC thingy
-   will ask for confirmation every time before giving you access to this
-   command prompt.
-
-   Once setup, this cmd window can be used to install Deadwood on Windows
-   Vista as per the directions for installing Deadwood in Windows XP.
+* Once Deadwood is installed, it is important not to change the directory
+  where Deadwood is locted; otherwise the service manager may have problems
+  finding the Deadwood service.
