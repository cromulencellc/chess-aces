Deadwood 3.3.03 changes how Deadwood, by default, solves DNS queries.
Earlier versions of Deadwood would perform a recursive query starting
with the ICANN root DNS servers.  Deadwood 3.3.03, on the other hand,
uses the https://quad9.net DNS servers as upstream servers when no
root nor upstream servers are specified in one's dwood3rc file.

To get the old behavior, add these lines to the dwood3rc file:

root_servers = {}
root_servers["."]="198.41.0.4, 199.9.14.201, 192.33.4.12, 199.7.91.13,"
root_servers["."]+="192.203.230.10, 192.5.5.241, 192.112.36.4, "
root_servers["."]+="198.97.190.53, 192.36.148.17, 192.58.128.30, "
root_servers["."]+="193.0.14.129, 199.7.83.42, 202.12.27.33"

Deadwood 3.3.02 introduces a new parameter: ip6
No changes to configuration files need to be made for this release.

Deadwood 3.3.01 introduces a new parameter: ip4
No changes to configuration files need to be made for this release.

Deadwood 3.2.14 is a bugfix update. No changes to configuration files
need to be made for this release.

---

Deadwood 3.2.12 is a security update.  No changes to configuration files
need to be made for this release.

A couple of minor changes that affect configuration since 3.2.02:

* Deadwood now exits with a fatal error when there are over 20,000
  upstream/root server entries in dwood3rc (older Deadwood releases would
  silently not work)

* Default file name for entropy in Windows is now "secret.txt"

* Default maxprocs increased to 1024; maximum maxprocs increased to 
  8,388,608 

---

Deadwood 3.2.02 is a stable release.  This release has a new parameter:
max_ttl, which limits how long an entry can stay in the cache; the default
TTL cap is one day (86400 seconds).  

---

Deadwood 3.2.01 is a stable release.  The default timeout has been decreased
from 2 to 1 second.  This will make resolution faster for the majority of
users; for users on slow connections with problems resolving domains,
add the following line to a dwood3rc file:

timeout_seconds = 3

num_retries now has a default value of 5 instead of 2.  To restore the
old value, add this to the dwood3rc file:

num_retries = 2

---

Deadwood 3.0.04, in addition to fixing a number of bugs, has added some
features.  In particular:

  * I consider it a bug if any valid dwood3rc file does not parse in Python 2.
    That in mind, I have updated the dwood3rc parser to not allow parameters to
    have any leading whitespace (since whitespace is significant in Python).

    This is OK:

recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

    But this will raise an error:

  recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

    (Observe the extra space in the left of the second example)

  * It is no longer allowed to set both root_servers or upstream_servers for a
    given name. In other words, a configuration like this will now raise an
    error:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "127.0.0.1"
root_servers = {}
root_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.1.1"

  * Deadwood now raises a warning when the same name is set more than once.
    This will now trigger a warning:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "10.1.2.3"
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "192.168.1.1"

    I was tempted to make this fatal, but decided not to because making this
    fatal would make it more difficult to manage large anti-phish/malware
    blacklists.

  * It is no longer permitted to initialize root_servers or upstream_servers
    more than once. This will now raise an error:

upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.net."] = "10.1.2.3"
upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["example.com."] = "192.168.1.1"

  * Deadwood will now raise an error for invalid lists of root or upstream
    servers. This is now fatal:

root_servers = {}
root_servers["."] = "foo"

  * Deadwood now requires that any bind_address is in the recursive ACL.  
    This is now fatal:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16"

    It can be fixed thusly:

bind_address = "127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.42"
recursive_acl = "127.0.0.1/16, 192.168.1.1/24"

Deadwood 3.0.03 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.0.02.  No changes made
will impact users.

Deadwood 3.0.02 is a bugfix-only upgrade of Deadwood 3.0.01.  

The one update that will noticably impact users is the fact that
filter_rfc1918 now filters more DNS replies.  In particular, DNS
answers with the following IP ranges are now filtered by default:

     * 192.168.x.x
     * 172.[16-31].x.x
     * 10.x.x.x
     * 127.x.x.x
     * 169.254.x.x
     * 224.x.x.x
     * 0.0.x.x

If one of the above IPs is detected in a DNS reply, and filter_rfc1918
has a value of 1, Deadwood will return a synthetic "this host does not
reply" response (a SOA record in the NS section) instead of the A record.

The reason for this is to provide a "dnswall" that protects users for
some kinds of attacks, as described at http://crypto.stanford.edu/dns/

If it is desired to have DNS answers with these IPs, add the following
line to dwood3rc.txt:

filter_rfc1918 = 0
