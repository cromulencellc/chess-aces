This is a bugfix release.

## Broker
- Fix clients being disconnected when ACLs are in use. This only affects the
  case where a client connects using a username, and the anonymous ACL list is
  defined but specific user ACLs are not defined. Closes [#1162].
- Make error messages for missing config file clearer.
- Fix some Coverity Scan reported errors that could occur when the broker was
  already failing to start.
- Fix broken `mosquitto_passwd` on FreeBSD. Closes [#1032].
- Fix delayed bridge local subscriptions causing missing messages.
  Closes [#1174].

## Library
- Use higher resolution timer for random initialisation of client id
  generation. Closes [#1177].
- Fix some Coverity Scan reported errors that could occur when the library was
  already quitting.
