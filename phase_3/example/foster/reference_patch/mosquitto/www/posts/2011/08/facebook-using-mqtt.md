Something else that has happened recently is the announcement by Facebook that
they're using MQTT in their new [Facebook Messenger app] They've posted some
details in a [facebook-engineering blogpost] and cite the low bandwidth and
battery usage as important considerations.

This is very exciting as an application that is potentially huge and very user
oriented (rather than "internet of things" oriented), but the really exciting
bit is if you use an iPhone under Settings and Licenses (apparently it's quite
hard to find):

Thanks to Michael Rowe for getting me the screenshot and Andy Piper for
pestering Michael on my behalf.

You should note that if you're in the UK, the Facebook Messenger app isn't
currently available.
