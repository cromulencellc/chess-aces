Using MQTT in PHP has been possible for a long time using the [Simple
Asynchronous Messaging] MQTT class. Unfortunately this is an imperfect solution
due to unclear licensing, some slightly dubious design decisions and bugs.

Thankfully, [Andrew Milstead] has started creating an alternative
implementation. It is MIT licensed and available on [github]. It's very new, so
if you have problems check back to see if there have been updates and then let
Andrew know.
