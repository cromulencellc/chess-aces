The web is currently buzzing with the announcement yesterday that IBM and
Eurotech are donating MQTT to the Eclipse Foundation. One part of this is the
new [Machine to Machine Working Group], again part of Eclipse. Another much more significant part
has been released as part of a new Eclipse open source project [Paho], which is
in the proposal stage.

The exciting part is the "Initial contributions" section which states "The
initial code contribution to Paho will include Â Java and C client-side
implementations the MQTT protocol, contributed by IBM. "

It looks like the code will be licensed under the EPL (Eclipse Public License).
This is particularly exciting because there is currently no solid freely
available and usable implementation of MQTT in Java.

Well done everyone at IBM for making this happen. Roll on the end of November!

Update:

This post on mqtt.org explains what the various announcements mean more
