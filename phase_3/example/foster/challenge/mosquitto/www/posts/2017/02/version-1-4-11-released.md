This is a bugfix release.

# Broker

 * Fix crash when "lazy" type bridge attempts to reconnect. Closes [#259].
 * `maximum_connections` now applies to websockets listeners. Closes [#271].
 * Allow bridges to use TLS with IPv6.
 * Don't error on zero length persistence files. Closes [#316].
 * For http only websockets clients, close files served over http in all cases
   when the client disconnects. Closes [#354].
 * Fix error message when websockets `http_dir` directory does not exist.
 * Improve password utility error message. Closes [#379].
 * Bridges can use asynchronous DNS lookups on systems with glibc. This can be
   enabled at compile time using `WITH_ADNS=yes`.

# Clients

 * Use of `--ciphers` no longer requires you to also pass `--tls-version`.
   Closes [#380].

# Client library

 * Clients can now use TLS with IPv6.
 * Fix potential socket leakage when reconnecting. Closes [#304].
 * Fix potential negative timeout being passed to pselect. Closes [#329].
