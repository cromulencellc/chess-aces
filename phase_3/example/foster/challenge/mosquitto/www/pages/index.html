	<p>Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that
		implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1 and 3.1. Mosquitto
		is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low
		power single board computers to full servers.</p>

		<p>The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying
		out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
		suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low
		power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded
		computers or microcontrollers.</p>

		<p>The Mosquitto project also provides a C library for
		implementing MQTT clients, and the very popular mosquitto_pub
		and mosquitto_sub command line MQTT clients.</p>

		<p>Mosquitto is part of the <a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse
		Foundation</a>, is an <a href="https://iot.eclipse.org/">iot.eclipse.org</a>
		project and is sponsored by <a href="https://cedalo.com/">cedalo.com</a>.</p>
