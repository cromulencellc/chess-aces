reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand
other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought
from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to
cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the
deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking
links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by
the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies
with its black hull close to the vessel’s, and seen through the
darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the
two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks,
whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.[14]

 [14] A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
 reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
 is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
 relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
 flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
 so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
 put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
 small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
 and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the
 ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the
 other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the
 chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the
 body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at
 the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.
