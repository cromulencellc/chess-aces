is savage’s
sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free
will, and necessity—no wise incompatible—all interweavingly working
together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending
to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
last featuring blow at events.

 Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
 strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
 of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
 whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees
 was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
 forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden
 intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that
 very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of
 whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those
 lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
 cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.

As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
announcing their coming.

“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
