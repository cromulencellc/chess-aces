tail! How you tink to hear, â€™spose you keep up such a dam slappinâ€™ and
bitinâ€™ dare?â€

â€œCook,â€ cried Stubb, collaring him, â€œI wont have that swearing. Talk to
â€™em gentlemanly.â€

Once more the sermon proceeded.

â€œYour woraciousness, fellow-critters, I donâ€™t blame ye so much for; dat
is natur, and canâ€™t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why
den you be angel; for all angel is notâ€™ing more dan de shark well
goberned. Now, look here, bredâ€™ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a
helping yourselbs from dat whale. Donâ€™t be tearinâ€™ de blubber out your
neighbourâ€™s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
belong to some one else. I know some oâ€™ you has berry brig mout,
brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small

canâ€™t hear notâ€™ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.â€

â€œUpon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
Fleece, and Iâ€™ll away to my supper.â€

Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
shrill voice, and criedâ€”

â€œCussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
your damâ€™ bellies till dey bustâ€”and den die.â€

â€œNow, cook,â€ said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; â€œStand
just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
