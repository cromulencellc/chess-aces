to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good advice.”
Lord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need most
themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”
“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine.
Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.”
“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work. The
consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his
common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are
bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly
uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical
of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes
are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of
second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot
write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”
“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his
handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on the table. “It must be, if 
you say it. And now I am off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don’t forget about to-morrow.
Good-bye.”
