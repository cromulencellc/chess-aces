curious my not wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”
“No; I don’t think so.”
“My dear Harry, why?”
“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.”
“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child about her.
Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her
performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power. I think we were both
rather nervous. The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom,
making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like
children. He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure Sibyl that I was
not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me, ‘You look more like a prince. I
must call you Prince Charming.’”
“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”
“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in a play. She
knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady
Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had
seen better days.”
“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his rings.
