of delightful freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high
indifference of joy.
Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them, with
black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward, started a hare. It
bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was
something in the animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and
he cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”
“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded into the
thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful,
the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.
“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an ass the man
was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he called out at the top of his
voice. “A man is hurt.”
The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.
“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing ceased along the
line.
“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket. “Why on earth
don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the day.”
