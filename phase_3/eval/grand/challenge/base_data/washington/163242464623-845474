Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe
swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them
into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It seemed to him that misfortune followed
wherever he went. He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the
affirmative answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly
alive with faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices. A
great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.
After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like endless hours of
pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started and looked round.
“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for today. It would not look well to go on.”
“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The whole thing is
hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”
He could not finish the sentence.
“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot in his chest.
He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go home.”
They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without
speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad
omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”
