of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all
day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing
for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up
prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the

music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon,
that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise. And this
was certainly true. Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his

This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept glancing at the
clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly agitated. At last he got up and began
to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long
stealthy strides. His hands were curiously cold.
The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of
