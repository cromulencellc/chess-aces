“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”
“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”
“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I don’t care what
shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be sorry to see you disgraced,
publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in
this horror? I should have thought you knew more about people’s characters. Your
friend Lord Henry Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else

were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or
gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is
merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less
horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece
