suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a wonderful study.”
“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t. If Dorian
Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself. You are much better
than you pretend to be.”
Lord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are
all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are

“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord Henry, putting his

the new chef here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about.”
“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their seats at the small
round table. “What happened was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry,
I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced
me to, and went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of
course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have
