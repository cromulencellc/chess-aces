engaged. I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.”
“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be absurd for him to
marry so much beneath him.”
“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is sure to do it, then.
Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.”
“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature,
who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect.”
“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry, sipping a
glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she is beautiful, and he is not often
wrong about things of that kind. Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of
the personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst others.
We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his appointment.”
“Are you serious?”

“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and down the room
and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly. It is some silly infatuation.”
“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take

is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts

the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to
marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack
individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex.
They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more
than one life. They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I
should fancy, the object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and
whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian
Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then
