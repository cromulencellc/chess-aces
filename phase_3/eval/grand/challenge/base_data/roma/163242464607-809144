might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke
the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips
moving, and smiled.
Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her. “Mother,
Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I love him. I love him 
because he is like what love himself should be. But what does he see in me? I am not
worthy of him. And yet—why, I cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I
don’t feel humble. I feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love
Prince Charming?”
The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks, and
her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to her, flung her arms round
her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me, Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our
father. But it only pains you because you loved him so much. Don’t look so sad. I am
as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!”
“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides, what do you
know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The whole thing is most
inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to Australia, and I have so much
to think of, I must say that you should have shown more consideration. However, as I
said before, if he is rich ...”
“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”
Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often
become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this
moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.
He was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in
movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would hardly have guessed the
close relationship that existed between them. Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and
intensified her smile. She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She
felt sure that the tableau was interesting.
“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the lad with a goodnatured grumble.
“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried. “You are a dreadful old bear.”
And she ran across the room and hugged him.
