attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be contented, James, with
your sea-faring life,” she said. “You must remember that it is your own choice. You
might have entered a solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the
country often dine with the best families.”
“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite right. I have chosen
my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t let her come to any harm. Mother,
you must watch over her.”
“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”
“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her.
Is that right? What about that?”
“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the profession we
are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention. I myself used to
receive many bouquets at one time. That was when acting was really understood. As
for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there
is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always most
polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are
lovely.”
“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.
“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has not yet
revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He is probably a member of
the aristocracy.”
James Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch over her.”
“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special care. Of
course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an
alliance with him. I trust he is one of the aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I
must say. It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming
couple. His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”
The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his
coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when the door opened and
Sibyl ran in.
“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”
