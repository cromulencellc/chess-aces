gold-fields at all. They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each
other in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one
evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by
a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in
love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live
in an immense house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him. But
he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly. She was
only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life. He must be sure,
also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to
sleep. God was very good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and
in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.
The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick at leaving
home.
Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. Inexperienced though
he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl’s position. This young dandy
who was making love to her could mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated
him for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not
account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was
conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature, and in that saw
infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness. Children begin by loving their parents; as
they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.
His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that he had
brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre,
a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door,
had set loose a train of horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of
a hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow, and
with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.
“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I am making the
most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”
“What do you want me to say?”
“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered, smiling at him.
