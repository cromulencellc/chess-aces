He shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you,
Sibyl.”
She flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.
“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me about him?
He means you no good.”
“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I love him.”
“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I have a right
to know.”
“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name. Oh! you silly boy! you
should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think him the most wonderful
person in the world. Some day you will meet him—when you come back from
Australia. You will like him so much. Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish
you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.
Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have him sitting
there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or
enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be
shouting ‘genius’ to his loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he
will announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only, Prince Charming,
my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor beside him. Poor? What does that
matter? When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window. Our
proverbs want rewriting. They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time
for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”
“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.
“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”
“He wants to enslave you.”
“I shudder at the thought of being free.”
“I want you to beware of him.”
“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”
“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”
She laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred.
Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will know what it is. Don’t look so
