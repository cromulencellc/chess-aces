passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look picturesque,
but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania
for going to church.
“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”
“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than anybody’s. It is so
loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says. That
is a great advantage, don’t you think so, Mr. Gray?”
The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began to
play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.
Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady Henry. I never

But he has been most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”
“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his dark,
crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile. “So sorry I
