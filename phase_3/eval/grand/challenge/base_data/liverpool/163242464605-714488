its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it,
must have something in store for me. I fancied a thousand things. The mere danger gave
me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening
when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret of life. I
