understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic
in a friendship so coloured by romance.
He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all costs. He
could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad of him to have allowed
the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.
CHAPTER X.
When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had
thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite impassive and waited for his
orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it. He could
see the reflection of Victor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There
was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.
Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he wanted to see her,
and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once. It
seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the
screen. Or was that merely his own fancy?
After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread mittens on
her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He asked her for the key of the
schoolroom.
“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of dust. I must
get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It is not fit for you to see, sir. It is
not, indeed.”
“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”
“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it hasn’t been
opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”
He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of him. “That
does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the place—that is all. Give me the
key.”
“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents of her bunch with
tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll have it off the bunch in a moment.
But you don’t think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”
“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”
She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the household.
He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best. She left the room, wreathed
in smiles.
As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room. His
eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece
of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent
near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps served 
often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its
own, worse than the corruption of death itself—something that would breed horrors and
yet would never die. What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted
image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They would
defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always
