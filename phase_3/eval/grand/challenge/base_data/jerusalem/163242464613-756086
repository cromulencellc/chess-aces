alive.
He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil the true reason
why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would have helped him to resist Lord
Henry’s influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own
temperament. The love that he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that
was not noble and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that
is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was such love as Michelangelo
had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil
could have saved him. But it was too late now. The past could always be annihilated.
Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were
passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow
of their evil real.
He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it, and,
holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was the face on the canvas viler than
before? It seemed to him that it was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.
Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was simply the expression
that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared to what he saw in it of
censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how
shallow, and of what little account! His own soul was looking out at him from the
canvas and calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung the
rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door. He passed out as his
servant entered.
“The persons are here, Monsieur.”
He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed to know where
the picture was being taken to. There was something sly about him, and he had
thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to
Lord Henry, asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that
they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.
“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in here.”
In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the
celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat roughlooking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose
admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most
of the artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He waited for people 
to come to him. But he always made an exception in favour of Dorian Gray. There was
something about Dorian that charmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.
“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled hands. “I thought
I would do myself the honour of coming round in person. I have just got a beauty of a
frame, sir. Picked it up at a sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe.
Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”
“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr. Hubbard. I
shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t go in much at present for
religious art—but to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me. It
is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”
