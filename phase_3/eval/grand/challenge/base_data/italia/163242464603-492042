“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor, striking the
table with his fist.
“The betting is on the Americans.”
“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.
“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase. They take
things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a chance.”
“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she got any?”
Lord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing their parents,
as English women are at concealing their past,” he said, rising to go.
“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”
“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that pork-packing is the
most lucrative profession in America, after politics.”
“Is she pretty?”
“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of
their charm.”
“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are always
telling us that it is the paradise for women.”
“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of
it,” said Lord Henry. “Good-bye, Uncle George. I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any
longer. Thanks for giving me the information I wanted. I always like to know everything
about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.”
