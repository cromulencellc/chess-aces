“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”
“I should like that awfully.”
The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. “I shall stay with
the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.
“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling across to him. “Am
I really like that?”
“Yes; you are just like that.”
“How wonderful, Basil!”
“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,” sighed Hallward. “That
is something.”
“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why, even in love
it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young
men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is
all one can say.”
“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and dine with me.”
“I can’t, Basil.”
“Why?”
“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”
“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always breaks his own.
I beg you not to go.”
Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.
