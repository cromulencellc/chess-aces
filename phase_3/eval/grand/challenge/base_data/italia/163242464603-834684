there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.
When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough shootingcoat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over The Times. “Well, Harry,” said the old
gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I thought you dandies never got up till two,
and were not visible till five.”
“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get something out of
you.”
“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit down and tell
me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.”
“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and when they
grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only people who pay their bills
who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine. Credit is the capital of a younger
son, and one lives charmingly upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s
tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not
useful information, of course; useless information.”
“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those
fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in the Diplomatic, things were
much better. But I hear they let them in now by examination. What can you expect?
Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he
knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.”
“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said Lord Henry
languidly.
