invariably told them my name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do
me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the
memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”
“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you must come and
sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”
“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed, starting back.
The painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do you mean to
say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have you pulled the screen in
front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen
away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt
the room looked different as I came in.”
“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let him arrange my
room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that is all. No; I did it myself.
The light was too strong on the portrait.”
“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for it. Let me see
it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.
A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between the painter and
the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you must not look at it. I don’t wish
you to.”
“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at it?”
exclaimed Hallward, laughing.
