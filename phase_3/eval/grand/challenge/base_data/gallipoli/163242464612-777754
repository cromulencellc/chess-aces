“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I called last night, and they
told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew that was impossible. But I wish you
had left word where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that
one tragedy might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me
when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that
I picked up at the club. I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you. I can’t
tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.
But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl’s mother? For a moment I
thought of following you there. They gave the address in the paper. Somewhere in the
Euston Road, isn’t it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not
lighten. Poor woman! What a state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did
she say about it all?”
“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some pale-yellow
wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and looking dreadfully
bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come on there. I met Lady Gwendolen,
Harry’s sister, for the first time. We were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and
Patti sang divinely. Don’t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing,
it has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.
I may mention that she was not the woman’s only child. There is a son, a charming
fellow, I believe. But he is not on the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell
me about yourself and what you are painting.”
