painting had gone off very much.”
Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began to stroke
the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail,

bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you? I
don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh! I remember your telling me years
