How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his letters. One
of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning. He hesitated
for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the
usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of
charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every
morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver LouisQuinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who
were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when
unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several very courteously
worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any
sum of money at a momentâ€™s notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.
After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown of
silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water
refreshed him after his long sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone
through. A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or
twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.
