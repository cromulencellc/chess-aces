“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A chance word I heard in
that damned den set me on the wrong track.”
“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble,” said
Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the street.
James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head to foot.
After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall
moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand
laid on his arm and looked round with a start. It was one of the women who had been
drinking at the bar.
“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his. “I
knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly’s. You fool! You should
have killed him. He has lots of money, and he’s as bad as bad.”
“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s money. I
want a man’s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now. This one is little
more than a boy. Thank God, I have not got his blood upon my hands.”
The woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she sneered. “Why, man,
it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.”
“You lie!” cried James Vane.
She raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the truth,” she cried.
“Before God?”
“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes here. They say he has
sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s nigh on eighteen years since I met him.
He hasn’t changed much since then. I have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.
“You swear this?”
