your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory
and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you
have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an
intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys
the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or

ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my
brains, such as they are—my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good
