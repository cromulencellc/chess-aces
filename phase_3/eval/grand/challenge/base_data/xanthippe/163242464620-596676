“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”
“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her whether, like
Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle. She told
me she didn’t, because none of them had had any hearts at all.”
“Four husbands! Upon my word that is trop de zêle.”
“Trop d’audace, I tell her,” said Dorian.
“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol like? I don’t
know him.”
“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,” said Lord
Henry, sipping his wine.
Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the
world says that you are extremely wicked.”
“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows. “It can only
be the next world. This world and I are on excellent terms.”
“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady, shaking her head.
Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly monstrous,” he said, at
last, “the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one’s back
that are absolutely and entirely true.”
“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.
“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you all worship Madame de
Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion.”
