as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a feast.”
Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that to me some
afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she murmured, as she swept out
of the room.
“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,” cried Lady
Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are sure to squabble upstairs.”
The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and
came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and sat by Lord Henry. Mr.
Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the House of Commons.
He guffawed at his adversaries. The word doctrinaire—word full of terror to the British
mind—reappeared from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix
served as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought.
The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common sense he jovially termed
it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for society.
A smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at Dorian.
“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed rather out of sorts at
dinner.”
“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”
“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to you. She tells
me she is going down to Selby.”
“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”
