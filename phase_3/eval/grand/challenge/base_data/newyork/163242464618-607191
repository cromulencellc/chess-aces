to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in
the sunlight now. How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness,
not for the day.
He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad.
There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them,
strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect
a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the
senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be
drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.
When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up
hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a good deal of
attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more than 
once. He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his
valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at
Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the letters, he smiled. Three
of them bored him. One he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look
of annoyance in his face. “That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had
once said.
