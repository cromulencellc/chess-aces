some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.
The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at least she was
always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them
lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music sounded richer and
more full of joy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her,
and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because
Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died.
But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real than they are.”
There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with silver
feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours faded wearily out of things.
