soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds
that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart
bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social
mistake, which would have been abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—
but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”
“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room and looking
horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy
has prevented my doing what was right. I remember your saying once that there is a
fatality about good resolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly
were.”
“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin
is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those
luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be
said for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no
account.”
“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him, “why is it that
I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I don’t think I am heartless. Do you?”
“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give
yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with his sweet melancholy smile.
