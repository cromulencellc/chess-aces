Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and
suns. Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold

turquoises with verses from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully

Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought
with fleurs-de-lis, birds and images; veils of lacis worked in Hungary point; Sicilian
brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and
Japanese Foukousas, with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged
birds.
