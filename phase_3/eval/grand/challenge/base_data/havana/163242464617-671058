worse behind. I know you and Harry are inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none
other, you should not have made his sister’s name a by-word.”
“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”
“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady Gwendolen,
not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a single decent woman in London
now who would drive with her in the park? Why, even her children are not allowed to
live with her. Then there are other stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at
dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London.
Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now,
and they make me shudder. What about your country-house and the life that is led there?
Dorian, you don’t know what is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to
preach to you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into
an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then proceeded to
break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want you to lead such a life as will make
the world respect you. I want you to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to
get rid of the dreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like that.
Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for good, not for evil. 
They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is

Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying
alone in her villa at Mentone. Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession
I ever read. I told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly and that you were
incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could
answer that, I should have to see your soul.”
“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost
white from fear.
“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his voice, “to see
your soul. But only God can do that.”
A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You shall see it
yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the table. “Come: it is your own
handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards,
if you choose. Nobody would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me
all the better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so
tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall
