“I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty. And they dress well, too. They
get all their dresses in Paris. I wish I could afford to do the same.”
“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir Thomas,
who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.
“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the duchess.
“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.
Sir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great
country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the
directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education
to visit it.”
“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr. Erskine
plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”
Sir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves.
We practical men like to see things, not to read about them. The Americans are an
extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their
distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I
assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”
“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite
unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.”
“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.
“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.
