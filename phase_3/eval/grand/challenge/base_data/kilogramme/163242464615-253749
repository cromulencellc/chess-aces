needs call forth sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted,
and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the
dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic
life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the halfcut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball,
or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing
seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life
that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over
us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome
round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open
some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our
pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed,
or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive,
at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy
having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.
It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true
object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would
be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential
to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really
alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it
were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that
curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and
that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.
It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic
communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him. The
daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him
as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive
simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to
symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest,
in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the
tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid
wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the “panis cælestis,” the bread of
angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the
chalice and smiting his breast for his sins. The fuming censers that the grave boys, in
their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle
fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black
confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and
women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.
But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal
acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that
is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are 
no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making
common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to
accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic
