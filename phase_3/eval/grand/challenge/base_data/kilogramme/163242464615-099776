had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the
dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King
Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss. When the
Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away—Procopius tells the story—nor
was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of
gold pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a rosary of
three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.
When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII. of France,
his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome, and his cap had double
rows of rubies that threw out a great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups
hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty
thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described Henry VIII., on
his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the
placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about
his neck of large balasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in
gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with
jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap parsemé with
pearls. Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove
sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash,
the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded
with sapphires.
How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration! Even
to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.
Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the
office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe. As he
investigated the subject—and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming
absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up—he was almost saddened
by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at
any rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed
and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was
unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom. How different
it was with material things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great crocuscoloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by 
brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had
stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was
represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined
steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on
which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the
mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes
that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with “lions,
panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from
nature”; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were
embroidered the verses of a song beginning “Madame, je suis tout joyeux,” the musical
accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square
