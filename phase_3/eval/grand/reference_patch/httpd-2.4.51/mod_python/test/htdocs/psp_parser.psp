# format of this file
# Comment lines are ignored (python or psp).
# Lines beginning with test will be included, which 
# includes lines generated by python code.
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# The test format is "test:expected_result:test_string$"
# where the string '$' is a token to indicate the end of the test line.
# The '$' character was chosen as it's unlikely to be in the output of
# the parser.
# In processing the expected_result,  the '-' character will be replace
# by the '\' character.
# The following substitutions will also be made in the expect_result
# LF	linefeed character
# CR 	carriage-return character
# TB	tab character
