there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its
influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead

into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it

summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with
leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness
would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the 
Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to
the coloured image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.
