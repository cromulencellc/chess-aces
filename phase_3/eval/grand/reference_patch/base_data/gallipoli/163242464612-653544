“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a strained
touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in
some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti
singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?
Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”
“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. “You must not tell me
about things. What is done is done. What is past is past.”
“You call yesterday the past?”
“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only shallow people who
require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow 
as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I
want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”
“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look exactly
the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for
his picture. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then. You were the most
unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you.
You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see that.”
The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the
green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. “I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last,
“more than I owe to you. You only taught me to be vain.”
“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”
