put, there was something that quickened his imagination.
For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be
to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the
fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of
the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with
his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real
degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.
For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back
his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.
Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places
near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away. On his
return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled,
at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and
smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that
should have been his own.
After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa
that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in
house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter. He hated to be
separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during
his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that
he had caused to be placed upon the door.
