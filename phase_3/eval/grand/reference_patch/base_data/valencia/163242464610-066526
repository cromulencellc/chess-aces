across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a
deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He

the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his young master sleep
so late. Finally his bell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile 
of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,
with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.
“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.
“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.
“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”
