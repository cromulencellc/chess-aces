in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people
whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.
Her tears and sobs annoyed him.
“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to be unkind, but I
can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”
She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little hands stretched
blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He turned on his heel and left the room.
In a few moments he was out of the theatre.
Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly lit
streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women with
hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing
and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children
huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.
As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden. The
darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl.
