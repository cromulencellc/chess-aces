Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might
remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and
the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted
image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep
all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish
had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think
of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the

Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had dreamed of her as
a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great. Then she had
disappointed him. She had been shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite
regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child.
