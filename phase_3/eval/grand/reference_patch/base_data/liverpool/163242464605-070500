the life of the intellect—simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must analyse it
some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw
away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt
you. Go on with your story.”
“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a vulgar drop-scene
staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house. It
was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The
gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and
there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress-circle. Women went

on.”
“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”
“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what on earth I

“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I must admit that
I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of

tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was
played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most
friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked
