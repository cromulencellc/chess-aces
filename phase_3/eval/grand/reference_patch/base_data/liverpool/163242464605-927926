worth loving is an actress?”
“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”
“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”
“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary charm in
them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.
“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”
“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life you will tell me
everything you do.”
“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious
influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you. You would
understand me.”
“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes, Dorian. But I
am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now tell me—reach me the
matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”
Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. “Harry! Sibyl
Vane is sacred!”
“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, with
a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why should you be annoyed? I suppose she
will belong to you some day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s
self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.
You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”
“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the horrid old Jew came
round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the
scenes and introduce me to her. I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had
been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.
I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the impression that I had
taken too much champagne, or something.”
