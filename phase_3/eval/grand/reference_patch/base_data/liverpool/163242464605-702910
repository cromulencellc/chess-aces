as if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly
seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited
coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the
petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life. You said to me
once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes
with tears. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came
across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with

cap. She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him
rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been innocent, and the black hands of
jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat. I have seen her in every age and in every
costume. Ordinary women never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their
century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one
knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is no mystery in any of them.
They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They
have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But
an actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me that the only thing
