“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in; “but I had
forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”
“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and blinking.
“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine to-morrow. I
have some work to do.”
“All right, sir.”
“Did any one call this evening?”
“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to catch his
train.”
“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”
“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not find you at the
club.”
“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”
“No, sir.”

he took down the Blue Book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.
