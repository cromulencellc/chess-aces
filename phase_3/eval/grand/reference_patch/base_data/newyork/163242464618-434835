hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, a press
in which he kept his own curious disguises, and put them into it. He could easily burn

He sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men were
strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of murder in the

Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he had intended.
With his curious reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be
roused. Months! Everything could be destroyed long before then.
A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the
hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement
outside and seeing the flash of the bull’s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and
held his breath.
After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting the door very
gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In about five minutes his valet
appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy.
