Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics were talking in low
whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying and wringing her hands. Francis was
as pale as death.
After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the footmen and
crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out. Everything was
still. Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down
on to the balcony. The windows yielded easily—their bolts were old.
When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their
master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty.
