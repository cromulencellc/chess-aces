“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want me to,” he
said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window. “But, really,
it seems rather absurd that I shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to
exhibit it in Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish
before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”
“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of
terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be shown his secret? Were people to
gape at the mystery of his life? That was impossible. Something—he did not know
what—had to be done at once.
“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going to collect all my
best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Sèze, which will open the first week
in October. The portrait will only be away a month. I should think you could easily 
spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it always
behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”
Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of perspiration
there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger. “You told me a month ago
that you would never exhibit it,” he cried. “Why have you changed your mind? You
people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only
difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten that you
assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any
exhibition. You told Harry exactly the same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam
of light came into his eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half
seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil to
tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a
revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.
“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face, “we
have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine. What was your
reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?”
The painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you might like me
less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I could not bear your doing either
of those two things. If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content. I
have always you to look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden
from the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or
reputation.”
“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a right to know.”
His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place. He was
determined to find out Basil Hallward’s mystery.
“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us sit down. And
just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the picture something curious?—
something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you
suddenly?”
“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing
at him with wild startled eyes.
