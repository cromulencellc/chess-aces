“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the
moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I
was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you. You became to me the visible
incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.
I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have
you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from
me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about
this. It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly
understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the 
world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad
worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....
Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you. Then came a
new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with
huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you
had sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You had
leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water’s silent silver
the marvel of your own face. And it had all been what art should be—unconscious,
ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a
wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in
your own dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method, or the
mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or
veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour
seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry.
I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then
it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little
annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked
about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I
sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio,
and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to
me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that
you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling
that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in
the work one creates. Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell
us of form and colour—that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far
more completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I
determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred
to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown.
You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry,
once, you are made to be worshipped.”
Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and a smile
played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the time. Yet he could not
help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to
him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a
