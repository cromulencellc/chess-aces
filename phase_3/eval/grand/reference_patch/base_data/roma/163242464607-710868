“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes. Good-bye,
Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is packed, except my shirts,
so you need not trouble.”
“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.
She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and there was
something in his look that had made her feel afraid.
