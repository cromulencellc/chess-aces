sulky. Surely you should be glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave
me happier than I have ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard
and difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world, and I have
found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by.”
They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across the road
