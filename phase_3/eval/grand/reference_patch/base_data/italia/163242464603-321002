it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a rattle of cups and saucers and the
hissing of a fluted Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a
page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly
to the table and examined what was under the covers.
“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to be something
on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it is only with an old friend, so
I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in
consequence of a subsequent engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it
would have all the surprise of candour.”
“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward. “And, when
one has them on, they are so horrid.”
“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth century is
detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only real colour-element left in
modern life.”
“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”
“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one in the
picture?”
“Before either.”
“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the lad.
“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”
“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”
