“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white
eyebrows.
“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who he is. He is
the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.
I want you to tell me about his mother. What was she like? Whom did she marry? You
have known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her. I am very
much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”
“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of course.... I
knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her christening. She was an
extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by
running away with a penniless young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot
regiment, or something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it
happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the
marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso got some rascally
adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do
it, paid him—and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing
was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards.
He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again.
Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl died, too, died within a year. So she left a son,
did she? I had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he must
be a good-looking chap.”
