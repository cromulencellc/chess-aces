“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”
“Why?”
“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth
having.”
“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”
“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when
thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its
hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm
the world. Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.
Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher, indeed, than genius,
as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or springtime, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be

your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that
there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs
that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it
wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against
your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. 
You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander
the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or
giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly
aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing
