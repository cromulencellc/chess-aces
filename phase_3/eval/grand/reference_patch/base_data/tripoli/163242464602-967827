He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do
that,” he murmured. “Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure
the senses but the soul.”
The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his
rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes,
such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils
quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.
“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of life—to cure the
soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful
creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want
to know.”
Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking the tall,
graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic, olive-coloured face and
worn expression interested him. There was something in his low languid voice that was
absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm.
They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But
he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger
to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship
between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life
who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be
afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.
“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought out the drinks,
and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never
paint you again. You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be
unbecoming.”
“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on the seat at the
end of the garden.
