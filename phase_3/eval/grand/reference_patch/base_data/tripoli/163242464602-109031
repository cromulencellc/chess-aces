“It is not my property, Harry.”
“Whose property is it?”
“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.
“He is a very lucky fellow.”
“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own
portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture
will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June.... If it
were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that
was to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in
the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!”
“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.
“It would be rather hard lines on your work.”
“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.
Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You like your art
better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as
much, I dare say.”
The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that. What had
happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed and his cheeks burning.
“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun.
You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I
suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one’s good looks, whatever they may be,
one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly
right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall
kill myself.”
Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried, “don’t talk
like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another.
You are not jealous of material things, are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”
