your drinks.”
They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white butterflies
fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to
sing.
“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at him.
“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”
“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are
so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a 
meaningless word, too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is
that the caprice lasts a little longer.”
As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s arm. “In that
case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then
stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose.
Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him. The sweep
and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except
when, now and then, Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance. In the
slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was
golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.
After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long time at
Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of one of his huge
brushes and frowning. “It is quite finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote
his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.
Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a wonderful work
of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.
“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the finest portrait
of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at yourself.”
The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.
