the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan, followed
by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody started up. The duchess stood motionless
in horror. And with fear in his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to
find Dorian Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.
He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of the sofas.
After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression.
“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?” He began
to tremble.
“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted. That was all. You
must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to dinner. I will take your
place.”
“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I would rather come down.
I must not be alone.”
He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his
manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he
remembered that, pressed against the window of the conservatory, like a white
handkerchief, he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.
