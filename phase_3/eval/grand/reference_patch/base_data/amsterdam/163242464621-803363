outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like a wet
mackintosh.
He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he was being
followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was
wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of the top-windows stood a lamp. He
stopped and gave a peculiar knock.
After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked. The
door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure
that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered
green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from
the street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had
once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the
fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of
ribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered with
ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings
of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with
bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his
head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar
that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who
was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got
red ants on him,” laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in
terror and began to whimper.
At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber. As
Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved
a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man
with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked
up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.
“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.
“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps will speak to
me now.”
“I thought you had left England.”
“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at last. George
doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added with a sigh. “As long as one has
this stuff, one doesn’t want friends. I think I have had too many friends.”
Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic
postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring
lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering,
and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better
off than he was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was
eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward
looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled 
him. He wanted to be where no one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from
himself.
