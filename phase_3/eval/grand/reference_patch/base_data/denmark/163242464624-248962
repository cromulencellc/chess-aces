leave her as flowerlike as I had found her.”
“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real
pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish your idyll for you. You
gave her good advice and broke her heart. That was the beginning of your reformation.”
“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things. Hetty’s heart is not
broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But there is no disgrace upon her. She can live,
like Perdita, in her garden of mint and marigold.”
“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he leaned back
in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously boyish moods. Do you think
this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank? I suppose she
will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of 
having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will be
wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great
renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn’t
floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round
her, like Ophelia?”
