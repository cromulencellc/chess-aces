gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming!
charming!”
The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s dress had
entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such as it was, struck up a few
bars of music, and the dance began. Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed
actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while
she danced, as a plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a
white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.
Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on
Romeo. The few words she had to speak—
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
 Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
 And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—
with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner. The
voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false. It was
wrong in colour. It took away all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.
Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of
his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them to be absolutely
incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.
Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act.
