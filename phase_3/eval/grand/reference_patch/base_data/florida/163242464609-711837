He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled
hands and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He
felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, 
upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and insisted on
shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had

watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight
flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had
taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each

them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and
discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.
“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.
“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all
living things. When she acts, you will forget everything. These common rough people,
with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the
stage. They sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do.
She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they
are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”
“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed Lord Henry,
who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.
