looks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”
“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio
towards Basil Hallward.
“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”
“But why not?”
“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any
one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be
the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest
thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people
where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say,
but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one’s life. I suppose you
think me awfully foolish about it?”
“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem to forget that
I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception
absolutely necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never
knows what I am doing. When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out
together, or go down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the
most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact, than I am. She
never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out,
she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me.”
“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil Hallward, strolling
towards the door that led into the garden. “I believe that you are really a very good
husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an
extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.
