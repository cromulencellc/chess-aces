always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then—
but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on
the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for
me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It
was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to
myself for trying to escape.”
“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the tradename of the firm. That is all.”
“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either. However, whatever
was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud—I certainly
struggled to the door. There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not 
going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously
shrill voice?”
“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy
to bits with his long nervous fingers.
“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and
garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses. She spoke of me as her
dearest friend. I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize
me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had
been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard
of immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose
personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes
met again. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.
Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken
to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards.
