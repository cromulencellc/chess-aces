Your cynicism is simply a pose.”
“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,” cried Lord
Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and
ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel
bush. The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were
tremulous.
After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be going, Basil,”
he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some
time ago.”
“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.
“You know quite well.”
“I do not, Harry.”
“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you won’t exhibit
Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”
“I told you the real reason.”
“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now,
that is childish.”
“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every portrait that is
painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the
accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter 
who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture
is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.”
Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.
“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his face.
