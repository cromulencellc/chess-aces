is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out of sorts.”
“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is afraid to tell me for
fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I certainly should.”
“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in love for a
whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”
“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady. “I really
cannot understand it.”
“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady
Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and your short frocks.”
“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I remember her very
well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how décolletée she was then.”
“She is still décolletée,” he answered, taking an olive in his long fingers; “and when
she is in a very smart gown she looks like an édition de luxe of a bad French novel. She
is really wonderful, and full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is
extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”
“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.
“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her third husband, Lord
Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”
“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”
“I don’t believe a word of it.”
“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”
