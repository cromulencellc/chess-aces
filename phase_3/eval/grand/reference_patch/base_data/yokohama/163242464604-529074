“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.
“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps it was. Well,
the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality we must see it on the tight rope.
When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.”
“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can make out
what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with you. Why do you try to
persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End? I assure you he would be
quite invaluable. They would love his playing.”
“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked down the table
and caught a bright answering glance.
“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.
“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry, shrugging his
shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.
There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should
sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,
the better.”
“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas with a grave
shake of the head.
“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve
it by amusing the slaves.”
The politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose, then?” he asked.
