Lord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England except the
weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic contemplation. But, as the
nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I
would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight. The advantage of the
emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not
emotional.”
“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly.
“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.
Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the
world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been
different.”
“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always felt rather
guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.
For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush.”
“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.
“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself blushes,
it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young
again.”
He thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you committed in
your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across the table.
“A great many, I fear,” she cried.
