seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she was perfectly wonderful. She
wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered
hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded
cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the
delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair
clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting—well, you
shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely
enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with
my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over, I went
behind and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes
a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each
other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life
had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and 
shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands.
I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of course, our engagement is
a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don’t know what my guardians
will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a
year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take my love
out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught
to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around
me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.”
“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.
“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.
Dorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall find her in an
orchard in Verona.”
Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what particular point
did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what did she say in answer? Perhaps
you forgot all about it.”
“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any
formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said she was not worthy to be my
wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her.”
