he had a right to know. It should have been told to him before, if it was as he suspected.
Leaden with fear, his mother watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips.
A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got
up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their eyes met. In hers
he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.
“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered vaguely about
