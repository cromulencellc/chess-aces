words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we
blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt that
he had been forgiven.
Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s voice outside.
“My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t bear your shutting yourself up
like this.”
He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking still continued and
grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life
he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if
parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and
unlocked the door.
“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But you must not
think too much about it.”
“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.
“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off
his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell
me, did you go behind and see her, after the play was over?”
“Yes.”
