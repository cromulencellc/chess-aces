“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came from? From
her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine. Every night of my

He shook his head. “To-night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and to-morrow night she
will be Juliet.”
“When is she Sibyl Vane?”
