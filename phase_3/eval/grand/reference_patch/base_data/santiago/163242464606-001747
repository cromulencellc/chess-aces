He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate
eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical
utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship
before her. To a large extent the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature.
That was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but
to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn
away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which
dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real
work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or
painting.
Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring. The
pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious. It was
delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing
to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one
of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from
one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.
