was all going to end.
When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram lying on
the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray. It was to tell him that
he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.
CHAPTER V.
“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face in the lap of
the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was
sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained. “I am so happy!”
she repeated, “and you must be happy, too!”
Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her daughter’s head.
“Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you act. You must not think
of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him
money.”
The girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does money
matter? Love is more than money.”
“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper
outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty pounds is a very large sum. Mr.
Isaacs has been most considerate.”
