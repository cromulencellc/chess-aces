way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you 
paint it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled into his
eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the
cushions, as though he was praying.
“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is all.”
“It is not.”
“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”
“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.
“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.
“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you
have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it. What
is it but canvas and colour? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”
Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and tearstained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set
beneath the high curtained window. What was he doing there? His fingers were straying
about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was
for the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He
was going to rip up the canvas.
With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore
the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he
cried. “It would be murder!”
