“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.
“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man. “He should have a pot
of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him. His mother had money,
too. All the Selby property came to her, through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated
Kelso, thought him a mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there.
Egad, I was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who
was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of
it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I hope he treated his grandson better
than he did the jarvies.”
“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the boy will be well off. He is
not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ... his mother was very
beautiful?”
“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry. What on
earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand. She could have
married anybody she chose. Carlington was mad after her. She was romantic, though.
All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women
were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed
at him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after him. And by the 
way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about
Dartmoor wanting to marry an American? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”
“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”
