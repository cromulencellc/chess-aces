“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more practical
than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage,
and they always remind us.”
Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed Dorian. He
is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any one. His nature is too fine
for that.”
Lord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,” he answered.
“I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that
excuses one for asking any question—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always

“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.
“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure.
All your theories, in fact, Harry.”
“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered in his slow
melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory as my own. It belongs to
Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test, her sign of approval. When we are happy,
we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.”
“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.
“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord Henry over the
