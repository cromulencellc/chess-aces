of her. You are mad.”
“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are going to
die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know what to say or do. “Down on
your knees!” growled the man. “I give you one minute to make your peace—no more.
I go on board to-night for India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”
Dorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know what to do.
Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,” he cried. “How long ago is it
since your sister died? Quick, tell me!”
“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do years matter?”
“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his voice.
“Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”
James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant. Then he
seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.
Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him the hideous
error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face of the man he had sought to
kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth. He seemed little
more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister
had been when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was not the
man who had destroyed her life.
He loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried, “and I would
have murdered you!”
Dorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of committing a terrible
crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly. “Let this be a warning to you not to
take vengeance into your own hands.”
