il._ There you have him.
However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is
still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
alien[3]. Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the
grand divisions of the entire whale host.

  [3] I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled
  Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of
  Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as
  these pig-fish are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the
  mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do
  not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented
  them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.

First: According to magnitude I divide
