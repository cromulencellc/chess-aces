knows what a pleasure is.”
“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some one.”
“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with some fruits.
“Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods. They
worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them.”
“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us,” murmured
the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They have a right to demand it back.”
“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.
“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.
“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give to men the
very gold of their lives.”
“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very small change.
That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the
desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.”
“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”
“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some coffee, you
fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne, and some cigarettes. No, don’t
mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil, I can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must
have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and
it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be
fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.”
