Lord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried.
As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm. “Let me
come with you,” he murmured.
“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,” answered Lord
Henry.
“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let me. And
you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so wonderfully as you do.”
“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry, smiling. “All I want
now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.”
