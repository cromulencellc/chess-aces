But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and
encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty
of literature.”
“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have literary
ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young friend, if you will
allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?”
“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”
“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything
happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.
But I should like to talk to you about life. The generation into which I was born was 
tedious. Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound
to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate
enough to possess.”
“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It has a perfect
host, and a perfect library.”
“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow. “And now
I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at the Athenaeum. It is the hour
when we sleep there.”
“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”
“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English Academy of
Letters.”
