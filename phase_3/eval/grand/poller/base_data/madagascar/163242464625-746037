long? Once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he
had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been away, he
had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it. It had brought melancholy
across his passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been
like conscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would destroy it.
He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He had cleaned
it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had
killed the painter, so it would kill the painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would
kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous
soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He seized the thing,
and stabbed the picture with it.
There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its agony that the
frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms. Two gentlemen, who were
passing in the square below, stopped and looked up at the great house. They walked on
till they met a policeman and brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, 
but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was
all dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched.
“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.
“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.
They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of them was Sir
Henry Ashton’s uncle.
