her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.
When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent him to bed,
and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over some of the
things that Lord Henry had said to him.
Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing for the
unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once
called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and
given horror to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had
experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it
had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame. But was
it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?
Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait
should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth!
All his failure had been due to that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought
its sure swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not “Forgive
us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the prayer of man to a most just
God.
The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago
now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as of old. 
He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the change
in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield.
