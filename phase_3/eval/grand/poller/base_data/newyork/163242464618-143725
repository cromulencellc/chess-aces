them as white as snow’?”
“Those words mean nothing to me now.”
“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God! Don’t you
see that accursed thing leering at us?”
Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred
for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had been suggested to him by the image 
on the canvas, whispered into his ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a
hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table,
more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly around.
Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him. His eye fell on it.
He knew what it was. It was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a
piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it,
passing Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and turned
round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him and dug
the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the
table and stabbing again and again.
There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood.
Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively, waving grotesque, stifffingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice more, but the man did not move.
