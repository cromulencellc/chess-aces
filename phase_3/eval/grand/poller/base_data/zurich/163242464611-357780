“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”
“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am not sorry for
anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better.”
“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would find you
plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”
“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and smiling. “I am
perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told
me it was. It is the divinest thing in us. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not
before me. I want to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”
“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you on it. But how
are you going to begin?”
“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”
“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him in
perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”
“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about marriage.
Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl
to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife.”
“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and
sent the note down by my own man.”
