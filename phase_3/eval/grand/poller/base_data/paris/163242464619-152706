dreadful.
After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly, but
watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for, “Alan, in a locked
room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead
man is seated at a table. He has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at
me like that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern
you. What you have to do is this—”
“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you have told me
is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life.
Keep your horrible secrets to yourself. They don’t interest me any more.”
“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest you. I am awfully
sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are the one man who is able to save
me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific.
You know about chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What
you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it so that not a
vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed, at the
present moment he is supposed to be in Paris. He will not be missed for months. When
he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change
him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in
the air.”
“You are mad, Dorian.”
“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”
“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you,
mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to do with this matter,
whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you? What is it to me
what devil’s work you are up to?”
“It was suicide, Alan.”
