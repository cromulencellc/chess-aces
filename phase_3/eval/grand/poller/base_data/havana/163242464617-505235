you, I don’t know what to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick
leaves the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen in
London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You used to be a friend of
Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week. Your name happened to come up in
conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the
Dudley. Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but
that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom
no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I reminded him that I was a friend
of yours, and asked him what he meant. He told me. He told me right out before
everybody. It was horrible! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was
that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend.
There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name. You
and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end? What 
about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his father yesterday in St. James’s
Street. He seemed broken with shame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth?
What sort of life has he got now? What gentleman would associate with him?”
“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,” said Dorian
Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt in his voice. “You ask me why
Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It is because I know everything about his life,
not because he knows anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how
could his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I
teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s silly son takes his wife
from the streets, what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across
a bill, am I his keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air
their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call
the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society
and on intimate terms with the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a
man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him. And
what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves? My dear
fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.”
“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad enough I know,
and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why I want you to be fine. You have
not been fine. One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.
Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them
with a madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there.
Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now. And there is
