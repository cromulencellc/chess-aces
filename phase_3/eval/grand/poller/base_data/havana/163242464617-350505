not at all a bad servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One
often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted to me and
seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you
like hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some
in the next room.”
“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap and coat off
and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner. “And now, my dear
fellow, I want to speak to you seriously. Don’t frown like that. You make it so much
more difficult for me.”
“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the
sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be
somebody else.”
“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and I must say it
to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”
Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.
“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own sake that I am
speaking. I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being
said against you in London.”
“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other people, but
scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not got the charm of novelty.”
“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his good name.
You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded. Of course, you
have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing. But position and wealth
are not everything. Mind you, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t
believe them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s face. It
cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things.
If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his
eyelids, the moulding of his hands even. Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but
you know him—came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen him
before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good
deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I refused him. There was something in the
shape of his fingers that I hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied
about him. His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face,
and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything against you. And yet
I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and when I am
away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about
