behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night. The lamp cast fantastic
shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.
When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking
out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low
voice.
“Yes.”
“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat harshly, “You are
the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me. You have had
more to do with my life than you think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door
and went in. A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a
flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he whispered, as he
placed the lamp on the table.
Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked as if it had
not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old
Italian cassone, and an almost empty book-case—that was all that it seemed to contain,
besides a chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that
the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a
damp odour of mildew.
“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that curtain back,
and you will see mine.”
The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part,”
muttered Hallward, frowning.
“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore the curtain
from its rod and flung it on the ground.
An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the dim light the
hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was something in its expression that
filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that
he was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that
marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on
the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue,
the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from
plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize
his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous, yet he
felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner
was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.
