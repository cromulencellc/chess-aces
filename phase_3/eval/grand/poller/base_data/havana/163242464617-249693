then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on his arm.
“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you in your
library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to
go to bed, as he let me out. I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly
wanted to see you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you
passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”
“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor Square. I believe
my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at all certain about it. I am sorry
you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back
soon?”
“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a studio in Paris
and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head. However, it
wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk. Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a

You see, I shan’t have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All
I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”
Dorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter to travel! A
Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get into the house. And mind you
don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious nowadays. At least nothing should
be.”
Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the library. There
was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth. The lamps were lit, and an open
Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass
tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.
“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me everything I
wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is a most hospitable creature. I
like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the
Frenchman, by the bye?”
Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s maid, and has
established her in Paris as an English dressmaker. Anglomanie is very fashionable over
there now, I hear. It seems silly of the French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was
