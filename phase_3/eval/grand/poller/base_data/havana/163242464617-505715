look on it face to face.”
There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his foot upon
the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible joy at the thought that some
one else was to share his secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was
the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous
memory of what he had done.
“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into his stern eyes,
“I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see.”
Hallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must not say
things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean anything.”
“You think so?” He laughed again.
“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good. You know I
have been always a stanch friend to you.”
“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”
A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a moment, and a
wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right had he to pry into the life of

and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing
cores of flame.
“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.
He turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give me some

absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny
them! Can’t you see what I am going through? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad,
and corrupt, and shameful.”
Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come upstairs, Basil,”
he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room
in which it is written. I shall show it to you if you come with me.”
“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my train. That
makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don’t ask me to read anything to-night. All I
want is a plain answer to my question.”
“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You will not have to
read long.”

He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close
