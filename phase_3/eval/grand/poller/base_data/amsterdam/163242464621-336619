years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in. Who else is
coming?”
“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the
usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”
“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find him charming.
He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely
over-educated. He is a very modern type.”
“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to Monte Carlo
with his father.”
“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By the way,
Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven. What did you do
afterwards? Did you go straight home?”
Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.
“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”
“Did you go to the club?”
“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I didn’t go to the
club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How inquisitive you are, Harry! You always
want to know what one has been doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing.
I came in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my latch-key
at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any corroborative evidence on
the subject, you can ask him.”
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let us go up to
the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman. Something has happened to
you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not yourself to-night.”
“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come round and see
you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady Narborough. I shan’t go upstairs.
I shall go home. I must go home.”
“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time. The duchess is
coming.”
“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove back to his own
house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come
back to him. Lord Henry’s casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the
moment, and he wanted his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.
He winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.
Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the door of his library,
he opened the secret press into which he had thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A
huge fire was blazing. He piled another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and
burning leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume
everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some Algerian pastilles in a
pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented
vinegar.
Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed nervously at his
underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made out of
