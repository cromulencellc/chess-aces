for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as
one would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had Basil to have
spoken to him as he had done? Who had made him a judge over others? He had said
things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.
On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step. He
thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium
began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously
together. He struck at the horse madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped
up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.
The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling
spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.
Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and he could see
the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked
as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The
horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.
After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven streets.
Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted
against some lamplit blind. He watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous
marionettes and made gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his
heart. As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open door,
and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The driver beat at them
with his whip.
It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with hideous iteration the
bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul
and sense, till he had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and
justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still
have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the
wild desire to live, most terrible of all man’s appetites, quickened into force each
trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made
things real, became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one reality.
The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very
vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression,
than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he
needed for forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.
Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over the low roofs
and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships. Wreaths of white
mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.
“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the trap.
Dorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and having got out
hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him, he walked quickly in
the direction of the quay. Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge
merchantman. The light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an
