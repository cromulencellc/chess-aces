ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that
could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He lit a cigarette
and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched
his cheek. But he still watched the cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he
had been lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A
triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped
in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer,
elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung
with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside was a
green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent.
He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his face. Then
shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot, he drew himself up and
glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the
cabinet doors as he did so, and went into his bedroom.
As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed
commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept quietly out of his house.
In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good horse. He hailed it and in a low voice
gave the driver an address.
The man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.
“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if you drive fast.”
“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and after his fare
had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly towards the river.
CHAPTER XVI.
A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping
mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in
broken groups round their doors. From some of the bars came the sound of horrible
laughter. In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.
Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray watched
with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he repeated to
himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, “To
cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that
was the secret. He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium dens
where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be
destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.
The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a huge
misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The gas-lamps grew fewer, and
the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the man lost his way and had to drive back
half a mile. A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows
of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.
“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!” How
the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was sick to death. Was it true that the
senses could cure it? Innocent blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah!
