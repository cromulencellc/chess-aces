James Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want you to come out
with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again. I
am sure I don’t want to.”
“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up a tawdry
theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She felt a little disappointed that

Her little feet pattered overhead.
He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to the still figure
in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.
“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For some months
past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers. Her
shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met. She used to wonder if he
