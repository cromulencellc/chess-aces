half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would have found me in tears. Even
Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going
through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No
one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down
here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious.
How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain
philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance 
redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he
succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to
do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear
old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened,
or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write
about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in
your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that
young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man
who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love
beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquerwork, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be got
from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still
more to me. To become the spectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the
suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not
realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now.
