Soul and body, body and soulâ€”how mysterious they were! There was animalism in
the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the 
intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the
psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary
psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various
schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body really in
the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a
mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.
He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science
that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it was, we always
misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical
value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule,
regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the
formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and
showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little
of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future
would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing,
we would do many times, and with joy.
