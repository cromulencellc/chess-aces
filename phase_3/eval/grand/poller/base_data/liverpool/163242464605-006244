am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had 
to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value
of nothing.”
“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an awkward silence
with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr.
Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you
at Lady Thornbury’s.”
“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her as, looking like
a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, she flitted out of the room,
leaving a faint odour of frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on
the sofa.
“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a few puffs.
“Why, Harry?”
“Because they are so sentimental.”
“But I like sentimental people.”
“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women, because they
are curious: both are disappointed.”
“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That is one of your
aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do everything that you say.”
“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.
“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.
Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace début.”
“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”
“Who is she?”
“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”
“Never heard of her.”
“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”
