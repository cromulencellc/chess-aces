For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately
offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought 
that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian
Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to
be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on the wearing of
a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate
some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered
principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.
The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling
a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than
themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms
of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never
been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the
world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of
aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty
was to be the dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through
history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such
little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture
and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely
more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had
sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with
the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his
companions.
Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to
recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our
own day, its curious revival. It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it
was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode
of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits
of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the asceticism that deadens the
senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was
to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a
moment.
There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one
of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those
nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep
phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in
all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might
fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of
reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble.
In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch
there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going
forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and
wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must
