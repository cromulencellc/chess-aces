doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in
tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white
nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit
on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been
said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared
with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is
when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the
soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.
And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling
heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw that there was no
mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to
discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one
mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets that woke the
memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that
stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes,
and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden
flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens;
of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel
melancholy from the soul.
At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room,
with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give
curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave,
yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while
grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet
mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed—or
feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals
and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and
Chopin’s beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell
unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest
instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few
savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch
and try them. He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women
are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected
to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries
of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the
sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular
sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were
shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but 
through which he inhales the air; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded
by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a
distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is
beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice
of plants; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge
