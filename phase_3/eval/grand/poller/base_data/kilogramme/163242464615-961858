cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz
saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he
has left us so vivid a description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated
him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her monsters,
things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of
them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening
in rapt pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a
presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.
On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as
Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty
pearls. This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left
him. He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various
stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by
lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot,
rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, fourrayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with
their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and
the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal. He
procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour,
and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.
He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s Clericalis
Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history
of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan
snakes “with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in the
brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition of golden letters and a
scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain. According to
the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the
agate of India made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth
provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out
demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour. The selenite waxed and
waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only
by the blood of kids. Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain
of a newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The bezoar, that was
found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. In the
nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer
from any danger by fire.
The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the
ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the Priest were “made of
sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison
within.” Over the gable were “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so
that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange
romance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one
could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through
fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo
