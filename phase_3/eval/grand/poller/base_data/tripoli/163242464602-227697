“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.
“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly to-day. I am awfully
obliged to you.”
“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?”
Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards
it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A
look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He
stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to
him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on
him like a revelation. He had never felt it before. Basil Hallward’s compliments had
seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened
to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had
come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of
its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow
of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there
would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless,
the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips
and the gold steal from his hair. The life that was to make his soul would mar his body.
He would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.
As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made
each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes deepened into amethyst, and across
them came a mist of tears. He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.
“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the lad’s silence, not
understanding what it meant.
“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is one of the
greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you like to ask for it. I must have
it.”
