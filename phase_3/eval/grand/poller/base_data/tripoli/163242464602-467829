impression that his words had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read
when he was sixteen, a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known
before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad
was!
Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true
refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from strength. He
was unconscious of the silence.
“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go out and sit in
the garden. The air is stifling here.”
“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of anything else.
But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I
wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry
has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful
expression. I suppose he has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word
that he says.”
“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the reason that I
don’t believe anything he has told me.”
“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy
languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is horribly hot in the studio.
Basil, let us have something iced to drink, something with strawberries in it.”
“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell him what
you want. I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on. Don’t keep
Dorian too long. I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is
going to be my masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”
Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the
great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine.
