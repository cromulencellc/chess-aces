  summary: reorder topic thumbnail
  description: This operation sets the order for a topic thumbnail. It can handle either topics (if a valid `tid` is passed in), or drafts. A 404 is returned if the topic or draft does not actually contain that thumbnail path. Paths passed in should **not** contain the path to the uploads folder (`config.upload_url` on client side)
