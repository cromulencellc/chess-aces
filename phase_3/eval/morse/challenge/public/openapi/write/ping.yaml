  description: This route responds with a simple `200 OK` if the Write API is enabled. Since there is no way of disabling the Write API, this will always return a success. However, it is also a good way to ensure the instance you are calling supports v3 of the Write API.

    Requires authentication. This route bounces back the data payload sent to it, and the uid the token resolved to.

    It is also a good way to ensure the instance you are calling supports v3 of the Write API. Also, as it requires authentication, it is a good way to check if the passed-in token is a valid token.
