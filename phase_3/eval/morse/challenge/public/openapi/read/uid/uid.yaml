  summary: Access a user's profile pages
  description: >-
    This particular shorthand is useful if you are looking to redirect to a user's profile (or other associated pages), but do not know or want to retrieve their userslug,
    which is part of the canonical url.

    For example, to go to `uid` 15's list of topics made, you can navigate to `/api/uid/15/topics`, which will send you to the appropriate canonical URL for that user's topics.

    - name: uid*
