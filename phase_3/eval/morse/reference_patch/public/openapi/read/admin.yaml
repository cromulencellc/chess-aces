    Internally, NodeBB will redirect you to a different page based on your privilege levels.

    The default is "dashboard" for superadmins and those with the "dashboard" privilege. If the requesting user is neither, then they will be redirected to a page that they have privileges to view (e.g. `/categories`, `/privileges`, `/users`, or `/settings/general`).

    Failing that, the request will be denied.
