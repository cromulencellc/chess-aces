==[ Translations ]===========================================================

In UnrealIRCd we support the following translations:
* on-line documentation at https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/ (wiki!)
* help.conf
* example.conf

For translating the wiki documentation see this article:
https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Translating_UnrealIRCd_wiki_pages

For the .conf files the following rules apply:
* You must translate the very latest (English) version of the document(s)
* The translation must be correct. Not just the spelling and grammar,
  but also 'technically'. You should therefore have some real experience
  with UnrealIRCd.
* Someone, usually the person who translated it, needs to be willing
  to actively maintain the docs. This is very important! If docs are
  out of date (out-of-synch) there will be confusion among users.
  We will remove documents that have been out of date too long (months)

If you want to start translating a document, please send an email to
syzop@unrealircd.org and mention the language you are willing to translate
to..  You will then receive an email back saying you can go ahead (or not). 
This is mainly to avoid multiple persons working on the same translation.
