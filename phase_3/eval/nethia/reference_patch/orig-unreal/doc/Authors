myriad bug fixes

Bill Wisner <wisner@hayes.fai.alaska.edu>: numerous bug fixes and code
enhancements

Tom Davis <conslt16@zeus.unl.edu> and Tim Russell <russell@zeus.unl.edu>:
VMS modifications

Markku Savela <msa@tel4.tel.vtt.fi>: advice, support, and being the
incentive to do some of our *own* coding. :)

Tom Hopkins <hoppie@buengf.bu.edu>: bug fixes, quarantine lines,
consolidation of various patches.

Christopher Davis <ckd@cs.bu.edu>: EFnet/Anet gateway coding,
many automata ;), documentation fixing.

Helen Rose <hrose@cs.bu.edu>: documentation updating, and fixing.

Tom Hinds <rocker@bucsf.bu.edu>: emacs client updating.

Tim Miller <cerebus@bu-pub.bu.edu>: various server and client-breaking
features.

Darren Reed <avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au>: various bug fixes and enhancements.
Introduced nickname and channelname hash tables into the server.

The version 2.2 release was coordinated by Mike Bolotski
<mikeb@salmon.ee.ubc.ca>.

The version 2.4 release was coordinated by Markku Savela and
Chelsea Ashley Dyerman

The version 2.5.2 release was coordinated by Christopher Davis, Helen Rose,
and Tom Hopkins.

The versions 2.6.2, 2.7 and 2.8 releases were coordinated by Darren Reed.

Contributions for the 2.8 release from the following people:
Matthew Green <phone@coombs.anu.edu.au>
Chuck Kane <ckane@ece.uiuc.edu>
Matt Lyle <matt@oc.com>
Vesa Ruokonen <ruokonen@lut.fi>

Markku Savela <Markku.Savela@vtt.fi> / April 1990
Fixed various bugs in 2.2PL1 release server (2.2msa.4) and changed
sockets to use non-blocking mode (2.2msa.9). [I have absolutely
nothing to do with clients :-]

Chelsea Ashley Dyerman <chelsea@earth.cchem.berkeley.edu> / April 1990
Rewrote the Makefiles, restructuring of source tree. Added libIrcd.a to
the Makefile macros, numerous reformatting of server text messages, and
added mkversion.sh to keep track of compilation statistics. Numerous
bug fixes and enhancements, and co-coordinator of the 2.4 release.

Jarle Lyngaas (nmijl@alf.uib.no) added Note functions to ircd.

Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> / May, June 1990:
* Patched KILL-line feature for ircd.conf, works now.
  Enhancement:  Time intervals can be specified in passwd-field.
  Result: KILL-Line is only active during these intervals
* Patched PRIVMSG handling, now OPER can specify masks for sending
  private messages, advantage: msg to all at a specified server or host.
* Little tests on irc 2.5 alpha, fixed some little typos in client code.
  Change: common/debug.c has been moved to ircd/s_debug.c, and a
  irc/c_debug.c has been created, for the benefit that wrong server msg
  are displayed if client does not recognize them. (strange, if a server
  sends an 'unknown command', isn't it?)

Tom Hopkins <hoppie@buengf.bu.edu> / September, October 1990:
* Patched msa's K lines for servers (Q lines).
* Consolidated several patches, including Stealth's logging patch. 
* Fixed several minor bugs. 
* Has done lots of other stuff that I can't seem to remember, but he
  always works on code, so he has to have done alot more than three
  lines worth. :)
