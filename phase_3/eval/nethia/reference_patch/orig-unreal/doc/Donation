Although UnrealIRCd is a free program, we do put a great deal of time,
effort, and money into keeping UnrealIRCd alive. If you like UnrealIRCd and
want to support us then please consider making a donation.

If you don't want to use PayPal, or you want to donate something other than
money, then please contact Syzop (syzop@unrealircd.com).

All those who donate at least a certain minimum amount will have their name

Thank you for your support,
The UnrealIRCd Team
