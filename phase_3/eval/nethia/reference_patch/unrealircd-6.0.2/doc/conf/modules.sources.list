# This file contains the list of repositories that are used
# by the './unrealircd module' command.
# Note that 3rd party modules are NOT written by the UnrealIRCd team.
# Use such modules at your own risk. In case of problems, contact
# the module author. For more information, see:

#

#
# This is the unrealircd-contrib repository which is added by default in
# UnrealIRCd to make it easy for users to install 3rd party modules.
# If you are a module coder and want to add your module to this repository
# as well, then read the rules and procedure at:
# https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Rules_for_3rd_party_modules_in_unrealircd-contrib
#
https://modules.unrealircd.org/modules.list

# You can add more repositories here. However, do note that all
# URLs MUST start with https://
