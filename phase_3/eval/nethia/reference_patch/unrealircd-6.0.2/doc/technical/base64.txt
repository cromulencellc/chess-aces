base64 Documentation (c) 2002 codemastr (Dominick Meglio) [codemastr@unrealircd.com]
(As of Unreal3.2-beta11)

The base64 system used by Unreal is defined as follows:

         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
         U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x
         y z { }

These numbers are translated to and from their decimal equivilents of 0-64 in order to
provide a shorter way of expressing a number.
