# This is the Competition file which defines competitions in progress.
# All competition information is automatically appended to the player
# whenever he enters the game and is not yet a participant (i.e. he
# is enrolled automatically!). Each competition structure is removed
# from the player when he enters the game and no such competition is
# in progress.
#
# The structure is hidden in the player's quest structure, and has the
# following format:
#
#    {"$competition", "<name>", "<start xp>", "<start playing time>"
#
# When you start a competition, set Ongoing to 1. When the competition
# ends, set it to 0 and reboot the game.
#
# Several independent competitions can be ongoing at the same time. When
# a competition ends, it will usually be set to not ongoing for a week or
# two. Then it is removed (from this file) and it will be removed from each
# player as he enters the game. Therefore, take great care that you do not
# name two competitions by the same *name*!! Always use different names.
# Each individual competition result is stored in compete/ but this is not
# removed automatically. You should do this manually occasionally.
