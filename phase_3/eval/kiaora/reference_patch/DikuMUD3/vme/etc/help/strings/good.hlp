You can have a good, evil or neutral alignment.<br/>
Good alignments range from +350 to +1000, with +1000 being ultimately good.<br/>
You become more 'good' as you kill evil mobs. Some guilds will only allow<br/>
you in if you are good and may not allow you to practice if your alignment<br/>
is not keep above 350. <br/><br/>
