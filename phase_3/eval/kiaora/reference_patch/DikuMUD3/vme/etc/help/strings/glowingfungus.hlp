Usage cast glowing fungus (target)<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
A nature spell that creates a sort of phosphorescent fungus on the ground in front of you. It will last for a moderate<br/>
time, then cumble away. It is very useful for illuminating dark caves, or finding your way to the<br/>
outhouse in the dark without skinning your shins.<br/><br/>
