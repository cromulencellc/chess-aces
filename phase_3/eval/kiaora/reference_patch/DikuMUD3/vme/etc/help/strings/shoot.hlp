These weapons require ammunition (except the sling, where stones are easy to<br/>
find and so do not need to be gathered). The Bow requires arrows, except in<br/>
the case of magical bows. The Crossbow requires bolts (again except in the<br/>
case of magical crossbows). The method of shooting is simple : hold the sling,<br/>
bow, or crossbow, and shoot away. Quivers are a good method of containing<br/>
arrows.<br/>
