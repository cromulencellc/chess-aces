Usage enter (item)|(keyword)<br/><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you will be able to enter various things on the mud. Such as a<br/>
canoe. If you wish to enter something, you can use this command. If the<br/>
thing you wish to enter is not an item, enter will work as if you moved in<br/>
a direction, except, it will use the keyword to determine where to move<br/>
you.<br/>
