Usage news<br/><br/>
<br/>
The news is a way for the implementors to inform the people of new areas,<br/>
bug fixes, quest, etc. You should always read the news when you first log on<br/>
to Valhalla. If you are using tintin or some other similar telnet program<br/>
you may find you have to type NEWS in all caps or you will simply walk<br/>
arounhd. You might want to check the boards in<br/>
Midgaard and<br/>
Udgaard for more up to date news.<br/>
