"describe"<br/>
<br/>
Usage describe (location)<br/><br/>
i.e. describe eyes<br/><br/>
<br/>
To change the default description, you now must do that online, with the<br/>
"describe" command. You may choose to enter a description for any body parts,<br/>
or for your general description, that which is seen when another character<br/>
looks at you.<br/>
<br/><br/>
To describe a specific body part, use the describe command followed by the<br/>
location you would like to describe. Body parts range from hair, head, and ears, to<br/>
butt, legs, and feet. Color may be used in your description using the syntax described<br/>
in "help color".<br/>
<br/><br/>
Once the command is entered, you will get a ']' prompt for your text.<br/>
To end your description, type a '@' on a single line.<br/><br/>

"password"<br/>
<br/>
 You must select a password for your player.  The password can be up to 8<br/>
characters long but must be at least five characters long.  The password<br/>
must contain both letters and non-letters. <br/><br/>
<br/>
 For your information, your password is encrypted and is unreadable even to<br/>
the administration.  If you forget your password you will be asked for the<br/>
following information before a new one is set:<br/><br/>
Maiden Name/Key Word<br/><br/>
Email Address<br/><br/>
<br/>
We can not confirm your ownership of the character without this information<br/>
and we will not allow you access to it so it is very important that you set<br/>
these two fields on log in. <br/><br/>
<br/>
To change yuor password online, enter the command "password"<br/><br/>
It will then ask you for a new password twice. Once confirmed, it is changed.<br/>
write it down!<br/>
