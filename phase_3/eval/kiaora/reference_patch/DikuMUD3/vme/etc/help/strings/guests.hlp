When you type 'score' you can see whether you are a guest or not, and if<br/>
you are a guest, quitting will 'erase' your character automatically.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
When you are a new player on the game, you will be a guest until you have<br/>
stayed on for 20 minutes, or until you use the 'save' command.<br/>
