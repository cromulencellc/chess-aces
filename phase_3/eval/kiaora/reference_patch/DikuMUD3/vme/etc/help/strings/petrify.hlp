Usage: cast petrify &lt;target&gt;<br/>
A spell to be reckoned with, Petrify allows the caster to turn flesh into<br/>
stone by sheer will.  The pain inflicted by this spell is considerable,<br/>
and anyone slain by it is instantly transformed to solid stone,<br/>
rendering any attempt to resurrect the victim useless.<br/>
