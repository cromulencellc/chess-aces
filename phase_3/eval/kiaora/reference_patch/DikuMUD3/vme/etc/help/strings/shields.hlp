Shields are an addition to armors which makes it possible to<br/>
completely block certain types of attacks and<br/>
spells. Some attacks are partially reduced by shields, such as the morning<br/>
star, and fire storm. Finally, some attacks are unaffected by shields<br/>
such as a whip and poisonous gas attacks.<br/>
