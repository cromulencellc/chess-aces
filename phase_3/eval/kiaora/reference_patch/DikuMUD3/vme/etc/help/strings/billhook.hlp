English bill hook was almost exactly the same as the French guisarme, but<br/>
its concave (hook) edge was the sharp one, and  rather than a straight back<br/>
spike it typically had an L-shaped tine projecting forward. This arrangement<br/>
was slightly more effective than the European guisarme. <br/>
