You can have a good, evil or neutral alignment.<br/>
Evil alignments range from -350 to -1000, with -1000 being ultimately evil.<br/>
Killing good aliment mobiles will make you more 'evil'. If your alignment<br/>
should reach -1000, it will stay there unless you perform a quest to have<br/>
it changed.<br/>
