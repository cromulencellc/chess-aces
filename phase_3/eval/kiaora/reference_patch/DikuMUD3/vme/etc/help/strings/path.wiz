Usage: path [&lt;unitpath&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
This wiz-command examines the shortest path-matrix for the game. With no<br/>
argument, it gives debug-info on compression-rates. If you give a unitpath<br/>
(zonename and unitname) it will return which direction is the shortest to go,<br/>
to get to the unit.<br/>
