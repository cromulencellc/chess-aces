Usage sail (direction)<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Example: sail east<br/><br/>
<br/>
When you are near water and have a boat in your possession, you can drop<br/>
the boat, enter it, and then sail out on the water (a river for example).<br/>
This command is thus used when you are inside a boat and want to sail in<br/>
a given direction.<br/>
