Mission Statement: The Drasnian Spies clan are a group of dedicated members who respect honor and loyalty amongst thieves, assassins, and, of course, spies. Each member symbolizes a finger from the mighty hand of the clan, granting us the ability to reach far-out in many directions simultaneously.<br/>   <br/>Spies understand better than others the concept that knowledge is indeed  power and actively seek out to obtain this greater fortune. Members are quick to understand and believe in the theory that everyone has a price and we are certainly not beyond bribery or trickery to obtain what we want. This, of course, means it is wise for a Spy to consider a few escape routes out of any potentially sensitive predicament. The Spies believe in a moral code of their own and prefer, by general consensus, to go through life with a lock-pick in one hand and a drink in the other. And although all Drasnians are spies, not all spies need necessarily be Drasnians.<br/> <br/>We are a clan heavily cloaked in deception and secrecy, trusting in no one but the shadows that work to hide us from sight. Our mission as Drasnians is to capture the ultimate power of forbidden knowledge and manipulate it to serve our cause, and possibly enjoy a good time while we're at it. The clan always protects and defends their own and will strike hard and fast, leaving no room for anyone to doubt the loyalty that binds us. We prefer to enjoy all aspects of life and venture to help each clan member be self sufficient as well as an integral part of the brotherhood.<br/>   <br/>You must be first above level 100 to inquire about joining our ranks.<br/>
