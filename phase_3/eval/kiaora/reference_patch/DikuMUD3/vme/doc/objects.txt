Document intended for:   World Creators

This  document  describes how the world creator specifies  objects
such as weapons, shields, armours, potions, scrolls, wands, staffs
and  how  to apply magical properties to items. Also included  are
guidelines for creating magical items.

2.   General notes about craftsmanship, material and magic bonuses

Note: In general each +5 / -5 could be said to equal AD&D +1 / -1 bonuses.

2.1  Craftsmanship (%, Table 1)
The  craftsmanship expresses of what material a weapon, shield  or
armour  is made and how well it has been constructed. The material
is  calculated  by selecting appropriate material &  craftsmanship
percentages from Table 1 and Table 2 below.   The result is an overall
craftsmanship in the range [-25% ..                              +25%].
Table  1  is  relative to the iron material. Notice  that  a  clubs
should not  get  penalties because it made of wood,  nor  should  a
spear  (with an iron tip). However obviously a sword would  get  a
huge penalty for being made of wood. In general there should be no
modification  on  a  weapons  default material.  A  wooden  shield
should not get -15% - it should just have fewer hitpoints  -  hope
you catch the drift...

Materia  Qty   Weight      Costl              Mul.        Mul.
Wood      -15%           ?     x 0.2                 (differs)
Bone      -14%           ?     x 0.3
Ebony     -13%           ?     x 1.7
Gold      -11%       19.30     x 512
Stone      -8%           ?     x 0.2
Silver    -10%       10.50    x 64.0
Bronze     -5%        8.50     x 0.8
Iron        0%        7.90     x 1.0
Steel       5%        9.00     x 200                    (rare)
Mithril    10%        6.00    x 4096                   (rarer)
Diamond    15%           ?   x 32768                 (extreme)
Table 1
This table translates materials into a quality relative to iron.
See  also  Table  2  for  craftsmanship  modifications.  The  cost
multiplier is multiplied onto the base cost of an item  if  it  is
made  from  other materials than listed as default (for example  a
long  sword of steel would have its price multiplied by  a  factor
1.8).  The Weight Multiplier is included for your information,  to
illustrate the relative weight of the various materials. The
craftsmanship is a way of expressing the overall quality of a weapon.
This  includes  both the skill of  the  black  smith  who created
the  weapon, the sharpness (where appropriate),  and  the weapon
balance. Use Table 2 for this purpose. Of course it is  not possible
to have a “none” sword of metal. NONE only applies  to weapons
created by nature (for example a branch).  The  resulting
craftsmanship is a percentage in the range [-15%..+15%].

Craftsmanshi  QTY     Cost     p                Mul.
None          -15%       N/A
Poor           -8%     x 0.6
Average         0%     x 1.0
Good            5%     x 1.5
Exceptional    10%     x 2.5
Divine         15%     x 4.0
Table 2
This  table  shows which effect craftsmanship has  on  Weapon  and
Armour  quality. The cost multiplier is multiplied onto  the  base
cost of a weapon.Examples:·     A bronze helmet made by a skilled
smithy would have -5% + 5% = 0% craftsmanship.·
An ordinary steel dagger would have 5% + 0% = 5%.
A rusty iron dagger would have -5% + 0% = -5%.
A normal reinforced wooden shield has 0% + 0% = 0%.·
A  diamond dagger made by a god would have no more than  25% even
though the tables would indicate 30%.

2.2  Magic Bonuses

Magic  bonuses can also be applied to weapons, shields &  armours.
It  is  in the interval -25% to 25% (0% is no magic). Remember  to
set the UNIT_FL_MAGIC if the weapon has any magic bonuses.

Power of Item Bonus  Maximum in World       Rent          Cost multiplier
Standard        +5        20-40          Approx. cost    x 1.0  Magic / 10
Powerful       +10        10-20          Approx. cost    x 2.0  Magic / 10
Demi-god       +15         5-10          Approx. cost    x 4.0  Magic / 10
God-Magic      +20         2-5           Approx. cost    x 8.0        / 10
Artifacts      +25         1-2           Approx. cost    x 16.0       / 10

3.   WEAPON CONSTRUCTION
To  create  a  weapon  you must determine the  following  specific
information about your particular weapon. The means by  which  you
create  a weapon also applies to the definition of the hand  of  a
monster.

3.1  Weapon Category

Select a weapon type from the file values.h (one of the WPN_XXX
macros which is larger than (after) WPN_GROUP_MAX). For example
WPN_DAGGER. The weapon category determines which skill is required
for using  (and defending against) the weapon.

3.2  Examples

A   standard   macro  “WEAPON_DEF(weapon_category,  craftsmanship,
magic_bonus)”  is available, and should be used for  defining  the
weapons values.Note  that both craftsmanship & magic bonuses are in
the range  [-25%..+25%].

A  flail (two handed) of non-pure iron (-3%), a little better than
average craftsmanship (5%) and no magic bonuses would have:
WEAPON_DEF(WPN_FLAIL, +2, 0)

A  rusty  (-5%) mean sacrificial dagger by a skilled smithy  (+5%)
and magically enchanted might be:     flags {UNIT_FL_MAGIC}
WEAPON_DEF(WPN_DAGGER, 0, +5)

An old shaky wooden stick could be:     WEAPON_DEF(WPN_CLUB, -5, 0)

A  wooden bastard sword would have considerable less craftsmanship
than  listed  since wood prevents the ‘slashing’ effect,  also  it
would  be non-sense to apply better than average craftsmanship  in
this case:     WEAPON_DEF(WPN_BROAD_SWORD, -15, 0)

Very  special weapons ought to exist only in limited numbers  even
if  they are not magical, for example, it seems unreasonable  that
hundreds of daggers made from diamond exists in the world. Perhaps
only  one or two such weapons exist. Use the max field in the load
or equip reset-commands.
The  macro  automatically sets the following manipulate  flags  so
that the weapon can be picked up and wielded:
manipulate {MANIPULATE_TAKE, MANIPULATE_WEAR_WIELD}

4.   ARMOUR CONSTRUCTION

Armours  are  designed just as for weapons. A  number  of  general
things  ought  to be noted for armours. There are standard  macros
for  many  types of armour - use these unless you are designing
something  unique  (like  a set of T1000 liquid  armour).  Armours
protect differently against the three different basic attack types
(slash,  pierce  and bludgeon) and differently  against  different
spell  attacks (i.e. plate is best against acid but worst  against
electricity).

4.1  Location

Location  is where the armour is supposed to be used, for  example
sleeves  are  usually put on the arms. To specify a location,  set
the  appropriate  manipulate  flags (MAINPULATE_WEAR_XXX).  Armour
only offers protection on the following body locations:
Head     Hands     Arms     Body     Legs     Feet

4.2  Examples

Standard macros are available and are used exactly as for weapons:
     ARMOR_CLOTHES(...)     ARMOR_LEATHER(...)     ARMOR_HRD_LEATHER(...)
     ARMOR_CHAIN(...)     ARMOR_PLATE(...)
A magical mithril full plate armour of good craftsmanship could be
assigned:     flags {UNIT_FL_MAGIC}     ARMOR_PLATE(+15,+5)

5.   SHIELDS

Shields are designed just as for armours & weapons. Use the  macro
SHIELD_DEF.

5.1  Category

The  shield  category must be one of (SHIELD_XXX,  values.h).  The
larger  the  shield,  the better the chance of  blocking  attacks.
Remember  to put weight on your shield to encumber the  character.
Shields are defined just as weapons & armours.

Shield Type
Small Shield   Medium   Shield
Large Shield

Table 3
Available shield types.

5.2  Examples
A small magical wooden shield could be assigned:
     flags {UNIT_FL_MAGIC}     SHIELD_DEF(SHIELD_SMALL, 0, +5)

6.   Various

6.1  Notes, Signs, Papers (reading)

When  you create a note with written text upon it, the proper  way
is  to  make an extra description with an empty keyword. The empty
keyword defaults to the name of the object itself.

Example:     note_7
names {“old paper”, “paper”}
.......
extra  {}
“The paper looks old and worn, and written in blood  you
see  the  words: Help free the world of the horrible evil
lurking lurking behind these doors.

”Extra {“blood”} “The blood is red!”
end

7.   MAGICAL ITEMS

This  chapter describes the rules by which magical items  must  be
created. The rules are made under the consideration that a  player
can equip a total of 17 items! It is therefore very important that
you carefully follow these guidelines.

Magical bonuses are applied to a player

whenever he equips a magical item.
When you create a magical item you should remember to set the unit-flag
UNIT_FL_MAGIC  so  that the detect  magic  spell  will  work
properly. But most of the used macros automatically set the  magic
flag. (flags {UNIT_FL_MAGIC}).

7.1  Identifying Magical Items

It  is  always important for the players to get information about
magical  items. The following method gives you the possibility  of
creating  textual identification descriptions for  the  “identify”
and “improved identify” spells.
Add  an extra description with the keyword “$identify” and it will
show the description when an identify spell is cast upon the item
Add an extra description with the keyword “$improved identify” and
it  will  show the description when an improved identify spell  is
cast upon the item.
Example:
crown_of_king
bla bla......
extra {“$identify”}
“This  once  used to be the crown of the evil lich king  Asmodeus,
the  greatest  of  the undead. The crown is a great  magical  item
rumored  to  give its posessor fantastic intellectual powers.  The
crown can only be used by evil persons.”
extra {“$improved identify”}
“The Crown of Asmodeus gives +5 to brain. Can only be used by evil
persons.”
end
As  you can see, the two types of descriptions associated with the
magical  items  gives  a lot more flavor to  your  magical  items.
Please  always include both descriptions on any magical items  you
create (they can be used on any kind of item, even unmagical ones,
but  most  likely there is nothing special to be said  about
non-magical items).

7.2  Rent on limited items
Whenever  you create a magical item, you must specify the  maximum
number  allowed in the world at any given time (the concept  world
includes  items  saved in the playerfile.).  The  following  table
shows  the  allowed  number of items in the  world  and  the  rent
compared with the items power:
