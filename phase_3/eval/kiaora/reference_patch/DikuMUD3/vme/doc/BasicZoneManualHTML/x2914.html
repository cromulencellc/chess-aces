previous chapter.  This is still not complete while it does compile and
you can log into your zone, you still have to load your NPCs and there

unbelievably large the ceiling seems to be a good 200 meeters high and
the room is perfectly cubic. Small human size ornate chairs with dragon
designs scrawled on the arms and back are arranged in a triangle like
setting with one large chair at the front.  This must be where all
station meetings are held. large pictures cover the walls depicting
dragons in all kinds of situations.  large passages lead of to the west
and the east.."

metal-plastic that all space agencies uses.  There are large plate glass
windows that open up into space.  The hallway is filled with a dim light
that seems to come from everywhere yet no where all at once.  You notice
a glimmer of bright light coming from the windows.  To the east you see
an air lock and to the west the hallway opens up into a larger room."
