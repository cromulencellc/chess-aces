>The, basic zone writing manual, you are reading now, didn't
just come flying out of this authors head.  In fact it is a
conglomeration of several old texts which are no longer used.  I had
first thought about quoting and giving credit to each person who had
ever modified or created portions of the first documentation but
because of the nature of the way they were built it was impossible
to know who did what.  I therefore have decided to create a list
here of everyone who has ever worked on or had a hand in the
development of the basic zone writing documentation and references.  I will also
give a short summary for each.
I would also like to thank those listed below for their contribution
to the development of one of the best mud servers on the internet
today.

You should all know these people they are not only the original DIKU mud
developers but a few of them designed and developed the new <ACRONYM

>VME</ACRONYM

server. One or more of the previous mentioned people were the authors of
the following texts that have been swallowed up by this book.
