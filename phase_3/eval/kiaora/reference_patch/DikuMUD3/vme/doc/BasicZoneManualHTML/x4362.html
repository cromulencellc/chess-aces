how you set the title, description and names fields.  The title and
description fields should ot have anything to do with the liquid inside
the container.  This means if you have a barrel full of water you do not
put the word water in the title or the description.  In our case we have
a bag full of wine so we do not put wine in either the title or
description.  The reason for this is if the player drinks the bag empty
and then fills it with water and we had put wine in the title or
description it would still be there but the bag would now be full of
water..  Our symbolic, title, and description would then look like
this.</P
