>Chapter 4. Unit building blocks</H1
><P
>When creating your zone you will find some basic
structures are used in all three unit types rooms, objects, and
NPCs. In this chapter we will define the main building blocks of
all units along with some helpful hints </P
><P
>No matter which unit type you are dealing with there is a
simple basic structure that lets the compiler know not only what
unit type it is dealing with but where one unit begins and where it
ends.  The way the compiler tells what unit type it is dealing with
is by the section header '%rooms', '%objects', and '%mobiles'.  All
rooms must be defined under the '%rooms' header and likewise objects
and NPCS under their respective headers.  Each unit starts with a
symbolic name called the unit symbol and ends with the keyword
end.  The following would be a legal definition of any
unit type:</P

this is not	 extremely useful it is good to know you can leave
out any field you don't feel you need.</P

In the last chapter we defined the different field types and
the rules you must follow when defining a symbol.  It is
important enough to relist these rules here so you do not run into
problems when creating your units.
<P

>The first letter of the
symbol must be a letter of the alphabet or a '_' character</P

letters, and '_' characters</P

15 characters</P

>It is also important to know currently it is hard to deal with units
having capital letters in them, this may be fixed in the future but it is
good practice to use all lower case characters in the
symbols.</P
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV
><P
>Another thing you should think about when defining your symbol
names is to be clear about what the unit is.  When you list units on
the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> server with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>wstat</B
> the symbolic names are
shown
if you were to see the list:
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>i6853 b2419 l1854</SAMP
>
You would have no idea what those three items were unless you
personally built them recently, therefore it is a much better coding
practice to name things what they are like:
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>long_sword healer_hut dog</SAMP
></P
></DD
><DT
>title field</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
The title field is probably the easiest field on all units it
is what is shown on the first line of a room when you enter and it
is the name shown when you get an object or attack a NPC.
There is only two important things to look at when defining titles
one is punctuation and the other is capitalization.  Room titles
need to be capitalized and so do proper names but the first letter of an object
title or a NPC title do not normally need to be capitalized. this is
best explained by some examples.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P

><A
NAME="AEN422"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;title "The dragons in."/*good*/
title "a big bull dog."/*bad has a period at the end*/
title "Bill the destroyer"/*good*/
title "A long dagger"/*bad capital 'a'*/&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>Now to show why some of those are good we will demonstrate by some
sample output in the game.
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>&#13;prompt:  l
The Dragons Inn
You are standing in a moldy inn.

prompt: get A long dagger
You get A long dagger.

prompt kick dog
You kick a bull dog. in the head.</SAMP
>
Notice the 'A' and the extra period do not really look right where
they end up appearing in the game.  These may be minor nit picky
details but if you do it right the first time you won't have to deal
with the english major that just happens to be playing on your
mud.</P
></DD
><DT
>names field</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
The 'names' field defines the names everything in the game can
use to interact with your unit.  For rooms the names are used as
teleport or goto points for characters and NPCs or they are
sometimes	used for special DIL functions on objects to trigger in certain
rooms.  On NPCs and objects names can be used for anything from
poking a player to giving a player an object.  The names field is
very flexible it has even been used to store what a container is
holding in order to have quick access to the names in the container.
 it</P
><P
>When making rooms it is not necessary to put room names.  In
fact it is a good way of making sure players can't teleport to
certain rooms because if the room doesn't have a name the person
can't teleport to it.  Objects and NPCs must have names because if
you leave names off of them you can not pick them up or kill them
depending on which you are dealing with.  It is also good practice
to use all combinations of the object or NPCs title so a
player will know exactly what to type to use the item for example:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN433"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;bad_obj
title a small dog"
names{"small dog","small","dog"}
end&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>It is up to you as a builder if you want to use names like 'small'
in your names list since you would not 'get small' in real life it
may not have to be added to the names list.  It is important however
to define your extras from big to small because of how the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
>
command interpreter handles names of things.  For example if you had
the following names:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN437"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;small_item
title "a small item"
names {"small","item","small item"}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>When you try to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>give small item Bill</B
>.  The interpreter
would try to give
small to item and that would not be what you wanted to do.  Don't
worry the compiler will catch this and give you an error something
like:
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>&#13;Fatal name ordering on line ###.&#13;</SAMP
></P
></DD
><DT
>descr field</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
The description building block is used in many places.  You will find
description fields on extras, exits, rooms, NPCs, objects, and as
you have already seen the help and the notes field of the zone
information section are also description fields.</P
><P
>  Depending on what
you are working on description fields can mean totally different
things to the person looking in the room.  A description field on a
room can be the inside or outside of the rooms description.  A
description on extras can be an NPCs descr or an extra description
on the room like if you looked at a 'rug' or a 'chair'.  On an exit
the descr field describes what you see when you look in that
direction from the room you are in.  The important thing right now
is no matter where you use them they all work the same.</P
><P
>description fields like the title field have a tag or unlike
the title field can have a set of tags before them like in extras or
exits but like titles they are just a string surrounded by quotes.
You can make multiple line descriptions if the description is on a
NPC you may not want to since it is the description shown when you
walk into the room.  The following would be some examples of room descriptions.</P

>extra fields</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
The extra field is the work horse for the builder.  It is the
building block that most brings your zone to life.  You can use it
to describe body parts or items in a room.  When you use
<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> you will use extras to store information like quest information
or special information you need later.  Extras also store the
main description on NPCs since the descr field on NPCs is really the
long title shown in the room which will be explained later
in <A
HREF="ch05.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>.</P
><P
>The extra Is the first structure definition you have run into
so it may take some playing with to figure it out.  The extra has
actually 4 fields three of them must be there in some form.  The
first is the identifier that tells the compiler that this is an
extra, the second is a stringlist, the third is an Optional
Intlist, and the final one is the extra description field.  If the extra
had all the fields it would look like this:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN461"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;extra {"small chair","chair"} {1,2,3,4,5} "Its a chair."&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>If the previous wasn't an example we
would have left out the Intlist because it is not necessary to put
the Intlist on a chair unless you want it there for some special <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
>
you are creating. the Intlist is the only field that can be totally
left out but you can leave the string list blank when you want
to make the extra the default description when the object, room, or
NPC is being looked at, like this:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN465"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;extra {}
"This would be what you see when you look at any of the names in the
names list."&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>We will go more in-depth into why you want to do this in the
following chapters.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P
>You are now ready to put these building blocks to work.  You have only
to learn how to put these fields to work for each of the three unit
types and you will be off and running.</P
