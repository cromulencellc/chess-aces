>When I first thought of writing this manual I had planned to leave
<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> totally out of it.  The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> language always confuses new Builders
and complicates teaching simple rooms, objects, and NPCs.  It became
clear to me though that <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is such a part of the server that I at least
had to mention it hear so builders would know where to look and
what <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> could do for them when they got to the point where they were
ready to use it.</P

><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is short for, Data-based instructional language.  Not to be
confused with Database since <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is nothing like a database.  Data-based
means that the language works on a fixed set of units like objects,
NPCS, and rooms and is designed to give them a life of their own. 
Unlike on many of the mud servers on the internet <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is not an
interpreted language it is a compiled language which gives you the user
much more safe guards against crashes and slow code.</P
><P
><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> also provides a full set of data types to allow you to do
calculations or store information from players.  The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> language can
even deal with file access and it can add fields and information to the
players if needed.  In short the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> server has its own internal
functional language that will allow you to do just about anything you
want to.</P
