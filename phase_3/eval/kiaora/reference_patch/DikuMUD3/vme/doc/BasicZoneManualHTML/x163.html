search and replace tool used by the compiler before it
converts the zone to its binary form.  This tool gives you the
builder the ability to add comments, create short hand expressions
for repeated items, include other files in your zone, and even to do
some minor calculations when necessary.</P

>2.2.1. Commenting your zone</A
></H2
><P
>The practice of adding comments to your zone is a good thing
to get into so the administrators and other builders can help
you with your zone and know what you were trying to do if there are
problems.  Comments aren't as important when writing the zone as
they will be when you start writing your own special <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> functions
but it is important to know how comments work and that you can use
them if you need to.  A comment is a block of text the compiler
will never see and is there only for you and who ever reads the
file.  In order to make it so the compiler will not see the block of
text you must surround it by a set of symbols that tell the CPP to
strip it out before passing the zone on to the compiler.  These
symbols are the '/*' and the '*/' symbols or the '//' symbols together in front of a single line.</P
><P
>In order to best explain how comments work we will give you a some
what strange example.  First we will start by showing you a very basic
line you will see time and time again in rooms.</P

><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>This of course is very ugly but the point is not to be pretty it is
to show you both the first way and the second way will look
exactly the same to the compiler because all comments are removed
before the compiler ever gets it.  A better use of a comment in a
zone however would be something like this:</P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;/*
The following ten rooms are the vineyards,
there are 97 rooms in the zone.
*/

//Zone first created 1994&#13;</PRE
><P
></P

>You will find comments will make coding large zones much easier
because you can add text meant just for the builders
eyes.</P

>You will have to decide if you want a multi-line comment or a single
line comment and use the '//' or the '/**/' respectively.  The rule of thumb is if the comment is longer than 1 line it is easier to put the '/**/' around the comment than to comment each individual line.</P

>2.2.2. Macros and what they can do for you</A
></H2
><P
>When making a zone you will find there are things you use more
than once.  In fact you may find things you want others to use or
things you want to use in multiple zones.  Its true you could block
and copy and stick them everywhere. in fact that is what I did when
I first started building.  I soon found my zone file was
extremely large and hard to upkeep.  With a few minor changes and a
lot of deleting I used short hand or better known in the world of coding
as macros to make my zone readable.</P
><P
>Lets say you had some flags you were going to set in
fifty rooms and you knew they would all be the same.  You could type
the following line 50 times.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN191"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;flags {UNIT_FL_NO_WEATHER, UNIT_FL_CAN_BURY}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>With the macros however you could make this much easier by just doing
the following at the beginning of your zone.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN194"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;#define DIRTFLOOR flags {UNIT_FL_NO_WEATHER, UNIT_FL_CAN_BURY}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>Then where ever you want the flags you just type DIRTFLOOR.  You are
probably thinking, yeah big deal I can do that with block and copy.
True but there is another benefit to this.  Lets say later you
wanted to also make these 50 rooms no teleport.  All you would have
to change is the define like this:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN197"

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;#define DIRTFLOOR flags {UNIT_FL_NO_WEATHER,UNIT_FL_CAN_BURY,UNIT_FL_NO_TELEPORT}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>Now when you recompile all 50 rooms are changed and you didn't even
have to do a search and replace.</P
><P
>You can also make macros that take arguments.  The ability to
take arguments is where macros take a leap and a bound out in front
of your favorite editor to allow you to do things you can not do easily
with search and replace.  Lets say you have an exit descr you
want to use in 50 swamp rooms because heck everything looks the same
in a swamp when you look one direction to the next.</P
