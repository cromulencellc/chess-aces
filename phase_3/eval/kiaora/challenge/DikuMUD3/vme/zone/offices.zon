Extra! Where are the King and Queen of Vasklor Extra! 
<br/>
(VP) Citizens of Vasklor laboring under the yoke of the Emperor Valmaloch 
 have mounted a surreptitious search for their missing King Amrod and 
Queen Elbereth as well as the prince and princess Amras and Amber.
Many fear the worst in spite of reports of letters proporting to be  
from the Queen in hiding being received by many. The king and queen
are not the only ones to have disappeared in Vasklor. Abandoned children
can be found in homes and wandering the park.<br/>
<br/>
One orphan when questioned stated 'a man came into town and claimed he 
was the brother of the King. He brought a bunch of thugs with him too!'
Research has shown that the king was an only child, yet a few days later
Amrod declared the man his long lost brother and left him as regent as
he and whole family went to visit the gnome king. Reports are they 
never arrived there.<br/>
<br/>
Citizens believe that their king still lives, but is imprisoned.
Yet recently some citizens received letters from an unknown source 
detailing the atrocities accomplished by the self-styled Emperor.
Are they a plea for help or a devious trap to do away with any
opposition? Only time will tell but one thing is certain. Something
stinks in Vasklor and it is not just the swamp.

A Note From The Editor
ooooOooooOooooOooooOoooo
<br/>
The world seems to have become a colder place in recent years. 
The influence of the demons and evil races has brought out the
the worst in many people and the watchwords of the day seem to be
greed and overindulgence. <br/> 
<br/>
Citizens have been spotted hoarding mushrooms, berries and  <br/>
other food stuffs. They set up caches of those things they 
cannot immediately use. They steal goods donated to the poor and 
sell then for as low as an iron and then the shopkeepers sell them
at their face value.<br/>
<br/>
We have to ask why. Why destroy the patch of berries just to  
have some hidden away? If you just take what you need then 
others can do the same, but hoarding leads to panic and to  
resentment. People begin to resent those with more or as some 
see it too much. Who could blame them?  If one person has all the 
food, then even if they share it they exert a power over 
others. They cause others to rely on them. <br/>
<br/>
Imagine you are hungry and you have always been given your food by 
the mayor. Each day you must wait in line and get your food from him. 
He decides when you can get it and how much you will get. Now what would 
if the mayor was eaten by a dragon or assassinated by an ogre?  Would  
you know where to get food? How to get it? Would you feel resentful  
that it was no longer provided? Or maybe you already resent that  
food is provided when the Mayor wants, not when you need it. <br/>
<br/>
It is no secret that some of the Citizens of Valhalla harbor a deep 
seated resentment against others. Even to the point of trying to buy 
friends to unite against others. This is a common tactic among followers 
of the dark paths. It is no surprise that many are trying to create
methods of controlling the populace of the world through first forming
a dependence then threatening to remove their support if their
minions show any signs of thinking for themselves. It is even said that
some have already caused those who were too independent to disappear. 
It has been noted that the only places in the world to get salad are in 
Xiyang and in the goblin town. Are these two working together? 
All evidence points towards that. Maybe the dark times are returning.<br/> 
<br/>
Another source was heard to blame the clans for hoarding weapons 
and tools needed for cooking and preparing food. Mary told the 
Valhalla Times that 'The orcs are too lazy to farm or hunt 
break into people's homes and steal their food and cooking pots!'
Could it be that clans are in cahoots with the evil races? Some claim 
this must be the case and make a point of being *clanless* claiming that  
clans are the willing or even unwitting catspaws of the evil ones.  
Others have pointed fingers at the clanless saying they do not want 
people to excel at anything that the clans may teach them. This 
reporter doubts that any particular clan may be serving the ones who
wish to dominate, but it may be some individuals are who are within the
 the clans. 
<br/>
So how do we tell the good ones from the bad? The ones that want to
help vs. the ones that want to control. And how do we get out from the 
control of the dark ones? Easy. If someone gives you food but does not
tell you how to get it yourself or even tells you it is not important 
they will take care of everything you need, they want to control you.  
If someone takes you somewhere to get your own food or even shows you 
how to grow it or hunt, then that is a person who wishes you to be in
control of your own future. Which is all any of us want - a chance
to grow and learn instead of stagnate under the weight of some 
dictator who tried to force us to do what we may not feel is right. 
<br/>

 The Spoils of War?
 By Aelle 
<br/>
The talk of the town has been about an individual of the name of 
Bertha who sent many citizens a plea for aid in her hour of need.  Her  
husband is dead, she and her children are on the run from assassins. 
For the duration of this article I will attempt to keep names out of
it to protect those innocents persecuted. But I have been in correspondence
with 'Bertha' as has report Kytes. Perhaps Kytes will provide us with
more information next issue. 
<br/>
Her letter states that she has a great deal of money available but 
she herself cannot collect for fear of her life. So she asks for any
one who can to help her retrieve a trunk full of platinum. It is a 
reported hefty sum is in the trunk and but it is held by a bank. 
<br/>
All of this sounded a bit odd, so I began to correspond with
her. According to herm she is a deposed queen. Her husband died   
in prison. A sympathetic guard helped her and her 2 children escape 
from the dungeons beneath the castle and they are hiding out in a foreign  
city. She is destitute, alone and to top it off frustrated because
if only she had the fee for the storage or a sponser she could change
all that. 

I asked why she was sending letter to strangers. She said she had gotten
my name from her old advisor as someone who had helped in the past. 
That much was true, so I continued my questioning and discovered she 
and her two children were at the mercy of the government who were  
threatening to deport and send her back. The thought of her delicate
children in the damp cell drove her to send the letters. Being a mother 
myself, I could empathize. Add to that her suspicion that the usurper is 
a servant of the Dark Queen who ravaged Midgaard in the not so distant 
past who could refuse? But how to help? 
<br/>
She asked that we meet at the bank and if I could see my way to loan 
her the money for the fee, I would receive a percentage of what was
in the trunk. So I prepared to leave, but circumstances have thus far 
halted me from completing the task. I would much rather help depose 
the usuper of her husband's throne and place her son on it. I am  
investigating ways to do that and then she can use her own 
treasury and advisors to reclaim her assets. Although I am skeptical
as to her authenticity, if she is who she claims, she has been done a 
grave wrong and it is up to us to correct it. Perhaps Kytes will have
more to report next issue.

Kytes has been seen lurking about and rumors are that he is behind the
strange letters received.

Kwar and Kalrai have been spotted holding hands near the old

 Whesland Hamlet  

  By Heulflodyn
<br/>
North of Udgaard kobolds have taken residence.  One day when  
assisting others to clean them out I was pushed through a 
wall of mud to begin an adventure I will never forget. I searched
my way out of the mess I found myself and wandered into a charming
town, Whesland Hamlet. 
<br/>
The hamlet is small, but fortified with a tall fence as if it  
expects an attack at any moment, It has some heavy protective
magic that kicks out evil that walks into their town. It also 
seems to have more than its share of problems. 
<br/>
I spoke to the mayor there. They had citizens kidnapped by kobolds.   
I helped one return home. Then there was the troll.  It seems some 
troll was halting trade between Whesland Hamlet and Udgaard. It had
wandered down from Galgachus and set up a blockade in the canyon.
So I took care of that problem and provided proof for the mayor 
but that was still not the end of the problems.   
<br/>
It seems a flying snake, perhaps even it is a type of dragon
had started burning and terrorizing the village.  I went to  
confront it. It had made a nest in a dead end canyon. The stench 
was horrible. The battle was difficult but I prevailed and again  
took proof back to the mayor. The final problem the good people of  
Whesland have is that the woods surrounding the town are filled 
with spirits. An old man had hidden something there and I had to 
go and find it. The problem was that the chest he used was invisible.
<br/>
Luckily the herbalist in town had some herbs that helped, but they
also let me see the spirits and made me hallucinate. But with the 
mission accomplished I still had to slay a couple of animals for the
herbalist to make a cure for the old man. However do not think the 
people who live there are not appreciative, the entire villiage turned
out for a presentation of a medal to me ny the mayor. The town is well
worth visiting when you need a break in your studies around half-way.
but no evil people need to bother. They won't let you in.

 Shoes, Gloves and Purse Pink!
 By Aelle Llofrudd-Gix
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen of Valhalla, I ask you with all the 
letters of margue passed out and the offers of some to 
create custom clothing. Why is that so many do not show
good taste in having your shoes, gloves and purse or bag match?
<br/>
There is no reason to face the evil hordes in any less than perfectly
matched accessories so that they at least will know their demise was
brought about by those with a civlized sense of fashion. I have
noticed SOME people make an effort in wearing their clan colors.
So many neglect the bag or purse. Why is that? 
<br/> 
The back or puse is your most common accessory, it is almost 
always with you. Of all the items you keep about you, this should 
is the one that most notice. Why carry around a natty burlap bag of holding
when you can sport a spiffy purse, knapsack or even ruckersack? Think 
about it. I know when I send shards whipping through the vitals of
an enemy, as the light leaves his eyes, he will gaze upon my beautiful
purple and blue purse as I take the gold he will not longer be requiring.
It makes me proud to know that some barbarian will know as his last
coherent thought that he was exterminated by a woman with a keen sense
of fashion.
<br/>
==============================================================

We urge all citizens of Valhalla to submit stories, news, poems, travelogs,
gossip and sagas of their adventures. There are a couple of guidelines
to follow which you can read on the Valhalla Times board upstairs
in the Chicken's Rest. <br/>

<br/>
It has been a while since we wrote an article for the times and a 
lot has happened. many new ideas, bugs found and lots of zones. First
the builder news:
<br/>
Of the new zones since our last printing, the winner of the 
builder's contest was Sentrosi for Murhabi. It was a close contest.
Issa's zone, Soul Lake has many innovative concepts and ideas of the
type we hope to see more of from the builders and the story is excellent.
Both zones are in pay areas and are for higher level players. 
Alvaneu opted to not enter the contest, feeling that he rather
do a good job on his zone rather than hurry to finish. But his
did get done and it tells the story of the Demonologists and
Ishlor's army. He took a unique approach to some aspects of the 
quest and zone in general and it deserves a look or three.  
<br/>
Also added were 3 new zones by Kutter our newest builder. They are
for lower levels and offer a lot of area to explore as well as 
promise of more to come!  They are located in a non donation area.
He has been working with just about all of the builders and has added
a lot of creativity to the building team. Not even the older players
know their way around the Mushroom Forest or the Glowing Caverns, so the 
newer players have an advantage. Sentrosi has also added a lower level 
zone that many may want to wait until the warmer months to explore. 
The Barren Isles are cold and the residents there have found ways to
stay warm and out of the wind.
<br/>
Baggins is working on the next phase of the night editor of the Times
as well as his own zone. He should have Elvira working smoothly soon
so that the paper will become much easier to publish and contribute to.
In the meantime though, stories are needed. We like a variety in writers
So see Aelle about contributing. 
<br/>
There have been many bugs reported with morph so we ask you use restraint
in using it. It maybe we remove it again until it is fixed but some forms
seem stable. Keep up the good work on reporting find path issues. We are
slowly finding the causes of that issue and fixing them as we go.
<br/>
Speaking of bugs, we have quite a backlog of them. Thanks to everyone
for reporting them and while it may take a some time, we are working on
in order of priority. Crash bugs are first, then worldwide ones, then zone
only, quest only then finally localized. We ask you report all bugs and
do not exploit them. If you are uncertain do not do it! We do nightmare
and/or delete players found doing so. 
<br/>
Lots of old players have returned citing the Facebook page as the reason. 
If you have a Facebook account please join the group. We also have a thread
on MySpace to replace the old group and of course the Twitter account. The
addresses are on MOTD, in the news and on the God Board in the Chicken's 
Rest as well at the end of this article.
<br/>
Kuros has been working on guild guides for each guild. They should give
new players an idea of where each teacher is and how to get around 
the guild. They are slowly being implemented as each one is finished.
Kuros has also a few ideas on how to help new players if no other 
players are around to assist. So look for improvements there. As usual any 
compliments or complaints concerning the Player Helpers, please mud
mail Kuros.

 Mushrooms Herbs and Tubers Oh My!
 By Alynon
<br/>

A Rangers Guide to Mushrooms and Herbs
<br/> 
Many of you young rangers out there have a chance to pick and gather 
a variety of mushrooms and herbs as well as some berries and tubers 
along the waysides. Many of these plants are great for eating. However, 
as some of you unlucky newbies have found out, not all things that grow 
in the wild are good to eat. While everyone likes a good fungi, many 
have side effects that range from poison to tripping your head off. The 
following is a short guide to help you keep safe while out there. 
Of course if your one of those hippy types who like being really out
there, you might consider this a guide to where to find the best stuff. 
<br/>
First off most of you young newbies get to explore the light forest 
west of Udgaard, the Haon-Dor. For the most part you are safe to eat 
anything you find in this woods, except the toad stools. The mushrooms 
are rather tasty and good in stews as well as soups and salads. There is 
a rather wonderful bush south of Mary's cabin that grows some beautiful 
berries. Those are great for eating raw or cooked in many dishes. 
As a rule of thumb however, any tubers or other random items you rangers 
dig up or find while searching for food in the woods, it's a good idea 
to cook it. Cooking over a fire tends too kill any poisons and molds in 
these items making them not only delicious when roasted but safe to eat.
<br/>
Now for the more practiced and adventurous, Nymgaard is said to hold a 
great number of interesting, delicious, and dangerous plant life. Many 
different types of forests surround the city of Nymgaard. East of the 
city is a strange area near a salt marsh that grows many different 
and dangerous plants. Some of them will even attack you so be very 
careful. As I have found in my travels the basic rule when dealing 
with mushrooms is leave the blue ones alone. Some of them poison you 
and some of them do much more. I have to admit once I got over the 
first peak of my trip it kind of mellowed out and wasn't so bad, except
for the mimes. However I still would suggest staying way from the 
blue ones. Puffballs are dangerous to even breathe in the spores, stay
away from them as well.
<br/> 
 
South of Nymgaard I found a strange forest that I got rather lost in. 
This place was filled with a great number of different types plant life
and fungi. For those of you starting out, gathering the red mushrooms 
might be a good idea. The have some strange natural healing properties. 
Not to mention they go great in salads. The blue ones here as I have 
said before stay away! But if for some reason you don't believe me and 
you just have to go and try one yourself, don't worry. It will all be ok, 
once that ill feeling kicks in just go hunting for some green mushrooms. 
This is the only place I have ever seen green ones, But lucky for you 
I have found they can counteract the effects of those nasty blues.
<br/>
As for the herbs that seem to grow all over the place. Good luck with 
that. Some of them are rather interesting and wonderful. While others 
can be dangerous or disgusting. I would not suggest making a salad of 
them. Unless you're willing too spend some time in bed sick as a dog. 
However if you're in a jam and backed into a corner you never know these 
herbs just might surprise you and save your life. So for those of you who 
love to gamble or take risks these herbs are for you! Just remember, the
herb shop in Nymgaard sells some pretty potent stuff and they must
collect it somewhere nearby.
<br/>
Overall, the great world of Valhalla has many different types of plant 
life. From forest floors, to shops in towns and other strange 
locations. Not all are good, but many can aid you in your travels. I 
suggest if you go out exploring and trying new things to be prepared. 
Like any good ranger, pack some healing balms and some poison antidotes 
and you should be ok. And for the gods' sakes, if you end up seeing
spiders dancing in the streets with green bears and cats under the stars,
leave your dang clothes on! We don't want to see you running naked down 
the streets! Especially if we just ate some of those blue mushrooms.

 Law and Order
 Enforcer of Truth
  by Kytes

Tegral upholder of truth seeing the failings of the current law system <br/>
 has started to forge a vigilante group of those who only seek to use  <br/>
justice for their own means and purposes. However for all sakes of 
objectivity can one really blame the cityguards for such failings?
they get paid a measly 3 or 4 iron pieces, are provided with lack luster 
equipment and weapons and lack the essential training needed to enforce 
the only true inpartial law that weve come to know as justice.
<br/>
Ah for the merriment of the young and the path they walk, for now a <br/>
new tool has appeared to combat the old evil and push forward the <br/>
strides of young warriors everywhere on their journey for personal 
truth and justice. 
<br/>
Regardless of intentions the mighty tool of justice has gone forward 
into the land spreading and encompassing many uses both the slaying <br/>
of slanderous mages and the mass eradication of the animated dead so 
beside the reasons of seeking the power of justice should we not simply 
turn and look at the results?
<br/>
Well this is for you, my readers, to decide. Should justice only be <br/>
based on results or the resolve and reasons of the enforcers of that <br/>
which keep our land in balance. Whatever the readers decidem to this <br/>
young reporter only one fact remains true and close to his heart. <br/>
THIS HAMMER CAN KICK SERIOUS TAIL.

[Kindred]<br/>
ooooOooooOooooOooooOoooo
<br/>
 The Loyal Guardians of our Ways<br/>
   By Gwymon Gwaedd-Gix
<br/>
So there have lots of one or another clan on for a while then
they all leave to do things in other places and the list
of citizens looks bereft of colorful clan tags. Except for Kindred.
As one player mentioned to me they always see Kindred. 
<br/>
Remember back when Tardaz wrote of the qualities we seek and why
we do not accept members for the sake of numbers? This is an
example of why we prize loyalty. We are not gathered together
in a large group to exert our will upon the citizens. We do not always   
gather together to sweep through a town leaving nothing but death and
decay in our wake. But we are here. There is usually at least one of 
us around. Because we are loyal.
<br/>
Where now are the ranks of yellow, blue, and cyan that ridiculed
Kindred for being so few. When they log in they lounge in their   
clans sometimes deigning to emerge to grace the non-clanned with
their presence and pearls of wisdom. Yet, Kindred remains out
in the land protecting it from the ravages of those who would
destroy our way of life. That is because we are loyal and only
accept those within our number that hold the same trait to be 
of the utmost importance. That is why we are Kindred.
