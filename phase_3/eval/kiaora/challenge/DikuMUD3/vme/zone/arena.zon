The arena is a place where one can enjoy some harmless PKing with out
worry of experience loss or becoming wanted. Your personal Equipment
is stored for the time you are in the arena and you are encouraged to
wander and see what you can find. You will find that the colored area's
are level specific and only players of those levels may fight in them.
However the main arena is open to anyone of any level so if some of you
lower players would like to try your hand at a high level player or a god
go check out the open area.

 Blue levels  1 - 12
 Green levels 13 - 24
 Yellow levels 25 - 39
 Red Levels  40 - 255"
