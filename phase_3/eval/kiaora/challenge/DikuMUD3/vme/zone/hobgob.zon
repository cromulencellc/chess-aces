"The Hobgoblins, feeling superior to all other races, have built a
prison town deep in the mountains. They run this town with an iron
fist, making the prisoners work in the mines till they collapse. They
repopulate their cheap labor force with the drags of society, the
thieves, murders and the mad, basically the members of society that no
one will miss if they suddenly disappear.
