The & (ampersand) character is used to escape all sequences.

Codes:

   &&          The ampersand character.

   &l          Text from this point forward will not be formatted. It will
               be interpreted literally with newlines, spaces, etc.
               Useful when making a sign or a map.

   &f          Text from this point forward will be formatted. This option
               is the reverse of &l and is default on any section of text.
               Formatted text is formatted using the rules described below.

   &s[num]     Force a singe space character (or <num> if specified, may
               come in handy, instead of having to toggle formatting).

   &n          Force a newline, very handy instead of toggling the &l
               formatting switch.   
			   
      &x          a file new line used for split so that you can split a file into lines

   &b<col>     Change background colour to <col>. Remember to set it back
               to the original background (black).

   &c[+]<col>  Change the foreground colour to <col>. If + preceedes the
               colour, then it will be highlighted.

The <col> is:

   n   : Black
   r   : Red
   g   : Green
   y   : Yellow
   b   : Blue
   m   : Magenta
   c   : Cyan
   w   : White


Sample colour codes: &cb, &c+b, &cw, &bg, &bn

   Sets blue foreground, bright blue foreground, white fg,
   green background, and black background.


All text used is formatted treated in the following way:

  o All leading blanks are stripped away. For room descriptions
    3 leading spaces are added. This way we ensure a consistent
    formatting of the displayed room descriptions.

  o Spaces and blanks (newlines) are contracted to single spaces
    yielding a correctly 'wrapped' text for any sentence.

  o If a '.' is encountered followed by a blank, a total of two
    spaces are inserted after the '.'.




	&[color_name]  This sets the forground and background to the players set colors
	for the color named in the brackets.

The colors that come default with the VME can be changed but here is a list of
them just so you can get an idea of possible ones.

When developing in color on a VME you must be careful to make sure your
colors do not become invisible because the characters can customize their
colors.  For example if you colored your text black and the character had
his/her background set to black the result would be the character would
not see your text.  The only way you can be sure that your colors will
always be seen is to both change the forground and background or use one
of the predefined colors like pc_title.  The following are some examples
of how colors should be used.

%objects

cup
names {"bright red cup", "red cup","cup"}
title "Bright &c+r&bwred&[obj_title] cup"

....

end

*In the previous object the word red was changed tot he color read with a
*white background so that it would show up even if a player had his obj_title
*color set to red.  Then when the color was done it was set back to the default using
*&[] to set it back to obj_title.

%mobiles

Fred
names {"Fred the fake","fred","fake"}

title "&[pc_title]Fred&[default]"
descr "&[pc_title]Fred the fake pc is standing here&[default]"

...

end

*In previous partial mobile descr Fred has been colorized to look like a pc
*Because it uses the characters set pc_title colors and at the end it sets
*the colors back to default.
