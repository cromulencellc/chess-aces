  This documentation is designed for people with some experience in programming.
Experience in C is recommended, but PASCAL or BASIC in some form or other
will do just fine too.

  DIL is a simple programming language with fixed types reflecting the types
used in Valhalla Mud. The language gives you almost endless possibilities in
designing your adventures and quests. It gives you the control you need for
making the game interesting and intelligent.
</center>
<IMG SRC="../images/backgr/waveline.gif" BORDER="0"  HEIGHT="18" WIDTH="100%"><br><a name="making">

<h3><b>Making a program:</b></h3>
<P>
  You define your DIL programs within your zone file. Each program you make is a
*template*. Such a template must be equipped with a unique name (for that zone).
Templates can either be defined in a new %dil section, just below the %zone
section in the zone file, or directly attached to units defined in your zonefile.</P><P>

  If you define your DIL templates inside a unit definition, that unit is
automatically assigned a program using that template. If you want to use an
already designed template, either in your own, or another zone, you use a
special function named "dilcopy", that takes the name of a template, and any
optional parameters in parenthesis. The parameters of a template called with
'dilcopy' may only be of types integer, strings and stringlists.
</P><P>
<b>Example:</b>

dilcopy myfunc@myzone("say Hello, my friend!", 1, CMD_SAY, {"name1", "name2"});

  DIL templates can always be reused. In fact, with version 2.0 of DIL, programs
are no longer saved with equipment, but only a symbolic reference is used. That
way, if you make a change in your zone, ALL units using that program are changed.
This however requires you keep the name. Upon loading, if a template is not
found, the program is halted and rendered useless until such a reference can be
found during loading.
</P><P>

<i>Technical note:</i>
</P><P>
  When you use several 'dilcopy' in your zonefile, only one instance is present
game-time, thus saving tremendous amounts of memory.  It is similar to a shared
library, in which code is shared  but variables are not.

You may use your templates to define both procedure and functions for your other
templates to call.

A template is defined by beginning with 'dilbegin' and ending with 'dilend'.
Inside the template your program section is defined, marked by the keyword 'code',
followed by the program itself;

<i>dilbegin myprogram();
var
  i : integer;
  j : integer;

code
{
  heartbeat:=PULSE_SEC*5;
  :start:
  exec("say Hello world", self);
  pause;
  goto start;
}
dilend</i>

  This simple template does nothing but making its owner say 'Hello world' once
every 5 seconds. The template is called 'myprogram' and takes no arguments. The
'pause' command waits for the program to receive a timer message, whose interval
is set by the 'inline' variable 'heartbeat'. The 'self' variable is a unitptr
referring to the unit owning the DIL program. Other inline variables will be
explained later.

  For a DIL program to work, it must be part of a *unit*: a room, player, non-player
or object. The program uses *messages* to operate.  Your program gets activated
when it receives a message that some command is being executed, or a certain amount
of time has passed. You decide yourself in the program, what to wait for, before
the program continues executing.

  Supposing you want your program to contain variables, you have to put them in a
section before the 'code' section marked 'var'. The variables are declared by
their type and their name, separated by a ':' and ended by a ';'

  For an example, see the program above. Variables of type 'string', 'stringlist'
and 'integer' are saved, if the unit the program is attached to is saved with
player inventory. Variables of type 'unitpr' and 'extraptr' are 'volatile'. This
means that they are cleared whenever there is a chance that their contents may
have been rendered non usable.  This ensures that you do not have any 'loose'
pointers. However it is possible to 'secure' the contents of a 'unitptr' type
variable of a unit located in your local environment (the units directly 'visible'
to the unit who owns the DIL program) (see the secure / unsecure functions).

<IMG SRC="../images/backgr/waveline.gif" BORDER="0"  HEIGHT="18" WIDTH="100%"><br><a name="types">
<h3><b>Data Types:</b></h3>

DIL supports a fixed set of types you can use and manipulate. Through these, you
can get and manipulate information about almost anything in the game. The types
are listed below:

<hr><a name="str">
<b>String:</b>

   A string is some text. They are used for a lot of things such as command
arguments, room descriptions etc. String variables are automatically resized and
allocated when you assign them, so you do not have to worry about the string
length nor allocation in your DIL programs. Strings may be compared either with
'==' (equal to),
'!=' (not equal),
'<=' (less than or equal to),
'>=' (greater than or equal to)  
'<' (less than),
 '>' (greater than.

  Static strings are defined just as in the rest of the zone, within double
quotations.  Strings may be searched easily with the 'in' operator.  Variables
of type string are saved with DIL programs, if attached to a saved unit.

<b>Example:</b>

  "This is a static string"

Strings may also be added to each other, in an expression.

<b>Example:</b>

  "say "+itoa(42)+" is the answer!"

<b>Example:</b>

  if (self.name == self.names.[1]) ...
  
  Elements of the string can also be accessed by referencing them by their position.
  
  <b>Example</b>
  if (str.[3]==f])
  {
  exec ("say The 4th element is a F.",self);
  }
  
  <B>Note</b>
  Currently you can only access the single elements of a string you can not set
them.  In the future this will be possible.  You can still accomplish this by
copying one string to the other one element at a time and changing any that you
want something like this.
  
<b>Example</b>
i:=0;
ln:=length (str);
while (str.[i]<ln)
	{
	if (str.[i]=="f")
	newstr.[i]:="b";
	else
	newstr:=str.[i];
	i:=i+1;
	}
	str:=newstr;
	
  This snip of Dil would replace any 'f' in a string with a 'b' remember dil is
not case sensitive so it will also replace an 'F'.

<hr><a name="strl">
<b>Stringlist:</b>

  A stringlist is a list of separate strings. This is used for things such as
(multiple) names or keywords. You may request a specified word in a stringlist
by its number.
<b>Example:</b>

  mystring := self.names.[2];

  Returning null if out of bounds of the stringlist (see 'length()'). Static
stringlists are defined just as in the rest of the zonefile, as a comma separated
list of static strings within curly brackets.

<b>Example:</b>

  mysrtringlist := {"Some string","another string","the last string"}

  Stringlists are modified through the 'addstring()' and 'substring()' procedures.
Stringlists are searched easily by the 'in' operator. See documentation below.
They can also be set directly (see example above).  Variables of type string are
saved with DIL programs, if attached to a saved unit.

  Elements of each separate string in a stringlist can be accessed by appending
a separate position at the end of the request for a string as follows:

<b>Example</b>
if (strlist.[5].[3]=="b"){
do something
}

<b>Note</b>
  See the strings for more information on accessing a single element.

<hr><a name="int">
<b>Integer:</b>

  Non-fraction numbers can be used throughout your DIL programs.  They are given
normally, or in normal C style hexadecimal, preceded with '0x'. Integers are
signed 32-bit integers.  Variables of type string are saved with DIL programs,
if attached to a saved unit.

<b>Example:</b>

  0x10

<b>Example:</b>

  2

  Integers are used within expressions as both number value and boolean(true/false)
values. You may use comparison between integers through the comparison operators:
'==' (equality),
'<' (less than),
'>' (greater than),
'<=' (less or equal),
'>=' (greater or equal)
'!=' (not equal).


<b>Example:</b>

  if (42<12) ...

  Returning the boolean value (true/false) depending on the comparison between
integers. The result may be stored in an integer variable, and tested later, or
used directly in an 'if' or 'while', etc.  You may also operate on boolean
expression themselves, using LOGICAL operators 'and','not','or', which allows
you to combine the expressions.

<b>Example:</b>

  if ( not ( (self.hp<42) or (self.level>10) ) ) ..

Integer expressions may also use a number of other operators:
'+' (addition)
'-' (subtraction/negation),
'*' (multiplication),
'/' (division),
'|' (bitwise or, for flags),
'&' (bitwise and, for flags)

Precedence rules for using these operators are still somewhat messed up.  You'd
better use parenthesis where ever possible.

<hr><a name="intlist">
<b>Intlist:</b>

  Intlists are an array of integer types.  They can be set directly as follows:

<b>Example</b>

wpn:={5,3,6,9,3,9};

The intlists can be accessed in the same way stringlist are accessed as follows.

<b>Example</b>

if (wpn.[5]==5)
{
do something
}

The intlists are saved on savable units.


<P>
<H2><A NAME="intlist"></A> <A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 The Integer List</A>
</H2>

<P><B>Type:  </B><CODE>intlist</CODE>
<P>
  This variable type allows you to keep an ordered list of integers with out
having to create a variable for each integer.
<P><B>Example:</B>  <CODE>Setting an intlist</CODE>

</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  If you set a index that is higher then the highest index, every index in
between will be set to zero.  For example if you only have two values in the
intlist and you set index value 10 to 50 all indexes between 2 and 10 will be
set to 0.

          <LI><A HREF="eptr">Extraptr</A></LI></p>

<b>Extraptr:</b><br>

  Extra descriptions, quests structures, etc can be searched and manipulated
using variables of this type. There is no way to declare static structures of
this type in DIL programs. Lists of extra descriptions are easily searched with
the 'in' operator (See below).  Extraptr variables are 'volatile', and thus
cleared whenever there is a possibility that they are rendered unusable.

  In order to get the first command in the list you use the following function:
<P><B>Function:  </B><CODE>chead();</CODE>
<P>If you want to get a specific command then you use the following function:

<h3><b>Messages:</b></h3>
<P>
  In DIL, a program attached to a unit gets activated when the program receives
a message. In order to save CPU usage, there are a number of different message
categories which can cause activation of a program.  The 'wait()' commands first
parameter is an integer, telling what message categories the program should
reactivate on.  The second parameter is an expression, which also must evaluate
to TRUE. 'pause' is just special instances of the 'wait()' command.
<a name="bpwait373"></P>

<strong>Caveat Builder: </strong>
<p>
  Whenever you construct the arguments for the wait command, bear in mind that
ALL your tests will be executed EVERYTIME a message of the relevant kind comes
through.  Thus you should keep the length of the activation expression to a
reasonable minimum, and you should NEVER use the time-consuming findxxx-functions.
</P>
Valid example (That prohibits a player from removing an object):
<PRE>
:glue:


	wait(SFB_CMD,command(CMD_REMOVE));
	u := findunit(activator,argument,FIND_UNIT_IN_ME,null );
	if (u != self)
	 {
		goto glue;
	 }
	act("You can't remove $2n, it's sticky.",
	   A_SOMEONE,activator,self,null,TO_CHAR););
	block;
	goto glue;

SFB_CMD            Command message

  When this flag is set, the program gets activated by all commands (legal
  or illegal) issued by PC's or NPC's. Moving around is also considered a
  command.

  Assume a janitor executes the command '
  Ge all from corpse',
  And Ge interprets to 'get'
  
  then this will occur in the DIL program:

     'activator'... is a unitptr to the janitor.
     'cmdstr'...... is a string which contains 'get'
     'excmdstr'...... is a string which contains 'ge'
     'excmdstr_case'...... is a string which contains 'Ge'
     'argument'.... will contain 'all from corpse'

     command(CMD_GET) will evaluate to TRUE.
</PRE>

SFB_DONE           'Command has now been executed' message

  When this flag is set, the program gets activated by all successful commands
  issued by PC's or NPC's. The 'activator', 'medium' and 'target' special
  values are used as follows:

     'activator'... The PC / NPC which executed the command
     'medium'...... The unit which is operated upon.
     'target'...... The target of the operation.

  For example, assume the player John gives a garlic to Mary the Lumberjack
  wife. The following values are set:

     activator == John (unitptr)
     medium    == Mushroom (unitptr)
     target    == Mary (unitptr)

  command(CMD_GIVE) will evaluate to true.

  You thus know that Mary has in fact received the mushroom. It is NOT possible
  to block (using the 'block' command) these commands since they have already
  been executed at the time of notification.  In a 'get' command, medium would
  be a unitptr to where the unit was taken from, and target would be the object
  which was taken.

  See the file commands.txt for a description of how the arguments are set for
  each command. If you can not find a command in there, just ask to get it
  implemented. Especially you should pay attention to the non-obvious SFB_DONE
  command(CMD_AUTO_ENTER).

SFB_TICK           Timer message

  When this flag is set, the routine gets activated by a "clock". The clock
  ticks (in 1/4th of a second) are determined by the 'heartbeat' variable.

     'activator'... is null.
     'argument'.... will be empty.

      command(CMD_AUTO_TICK) will evaluate to TRUE.
<hr><a name="sfbcom">
SFB_COM            Combat message

  When this flag is set, the routine gets activated whenever a combat is in
  progress. The unit containing the DIL program needs not be involved in the
  combat itself:

     'activator'... is a unitptr to the PC/NPC about to hit someone else.
     'argument'.... is empty.

      command(CMD_AUTO_COMBAT) will evaluate to TRUE.
<hr><a name="sfbdead">
SFB_DEAD           Death message

  When this flag is set, the routine gets activated when a PC or NPC dies:

     'activator'... will point to the PC/NPC that is about to die.
     'argument'.... is empty.

      command(CMD_AUTO_DEATH) will evaluate to TRUE

  The SFB_DEAD message is sent, just as the character dies, while his items are
  still equipped, just before the corpse is created.  The character's '.fighting'
  field points to his primary opponent, although this person does not necessarily
  have to be the one that killed him.

  This can be exploited by making items wiz invisible (the .minv field) just as
  the message is received, causing them to stay inside the player rather than
  being transferred to the corpse. This does both give the ultimate crash
  protection, as well as a means of letting items, such as bribe items, forever
  be a part of the player (remember to make it un-wizinvis when the player
  returns from heaven - players should not have access to items while in heaven).
</PRE>
<hr><a name="sfbmsg">
<PRE>
SFB_MSG            User message

  When this flag is set, the routine gets activated when a message is passed
  to it. Messages can be passed with the DIL commands 'sendto' and 'send':

     'activator'... is a unitptr to the unit sending the message.
     'argument'.... is a string containing possible data from the sender.

      command(CMD_AUTO_MSG) will evaluate to true.


  Messages are normally not generated by actions performed by the owner of the
  program. For a program to be able to be aware of messages from the owner, a
  keyword 'aware' should be listed just after 'dilbegin'.

  When a unit is saved, normally, the DIL programs in it would restart when the
  program is loaded. However it is possible to let DIL programs recall their
  execution from where they left off when they where saved.  This is done by
  listing the keyword 'recall' after the 'dilbegin'.  This is however a bit
  limited.  Only the status of the original template are saved. Not the state
  inside a template called as a function or procedure from inside the original
  template. 'secure' and interrupts are not recalled upon loading the template.


<b>Example:</b>

<i>dilbegin recall aware mute();
var
   i : integer;

code
{
   i:=10;
   while (i>0)
   {
      wait(SFB_CMD,command(CMD_SAY) or command(CMD_SHOUT));
      exec("emote tries to make a sound, but only blood spurts through"+
           "the lips",self);
      block;
      i := i - 1;
   }

   i:=10;
   while (i>0)
   {
      wait(SFB_CMD,command(CMD_SAY) or command(CMD_SHOUT));
      exec("emote tries to make a sound, but can't",self);
      block;
      i := i - 1;
   }

   i:=10;
   while (i>0)
   {
      wait(SFB_CMD,command(CMD_SAY) or command(CMD_SHOUT));
      exec("emote tries to make a loud sound, but can't",self);
      block;
      i := i - 1;
   }
   quit;
}
dilend</i>

/* When attached to a PC, the pc will be unable to utter a sound the first 10
   sound command, and blood will spurt out.
   The next 10 sound commands, the victim just can't shout.
   The last 10 sound commands only say will work.
   In the end, 'quit' removes the program all together.
   The smart thing is that the 'aware' keyword lets the program receive messages
   from the owner (player) commands. Secondly, the keyword 'recall' makes sure
   that the program does not start over, if the victim quits in the middle, but
   restart at the position it had attained.
   Do not put in the 'aware' if it is not needed. It saves some interpretation
   time not having to pass the extra messages.

SFB_PRE            Command preprocessing

  When this flag is set, the program is activated by a few special events
  which can then be blocked or changed. Currently, this event is triggered
  just prior to a spell being cast, and just prior to any sort of damage
  being given to a target.

  PRE "command(CMD_CAST)"

  Assume a a spell is cast from player A on player B with a scroll C.

     'activator'... is a unitptr to A.
     'medium'   ... is a unitptr to C.
     'target'   ... is a unitptr to B.

     command(CMD_CAST) will evaluate to TRUE.

     'argument'.... will contain a number followed by any
                    argument to the spell itself. You should
                    parse this number, it equals the spell number SPL_XXX.
     'power' ....   is set to 'HM', i.e. how powerful the spell cast
                    is going to be. YOu can change this number at will.
                    If you decide to block the spell, you ought to set it
                    to -1.

Example:
   wait(SFB_PRE, command(CMD_CAST));

   s := getword(argument);
   splno := atoi(s);

   if (splno == SPL_FIREBALL_3)
     power := 0; /* No damage */
   ...


  PRE "command(CMD_AUTO_DAMAGE)"

  Assume that damage is given from player A to player B with a sword C.

     'activator'... is a unitptr to A.
     'medium'   ... is a unitptr to C.
     'target'   ... is a unitptr to B.

     command(CMD_AUTO_DAMAGE) will evaluate to TRUE.

     'power' ....   is set to how much damage will be given. You can change
                    this number at will, but you should not set it to less
                    than zero.

     'argument'.... will contain three numbers that you must parse to
                    determine what kind of damage we're talking about.

                    First number is the attack group, this can be one of
                    MSG_TYPE_XXX from values.h and/or vme.h.

                    Second number is dependant on the attack group and
                    identifies what damage compared to the group. For
                    example WPN_XXX for weapon group.

                    Third number is the body hit location, one of WEAR_XXX,
                    (but not all of them, just hands, feet, legs, body, head,
                     arms, i.e. the armour positions, not positions like finger
                     or ear).


Example:
   wait(SFB_PRE, command(CMD_AUTO_DAMAGE));

   s1 := getword(argument);
   grpno := atoi(s1);

   s2 := getword(argument);
   atkno := atoi(s2);

   s3 := getword(argument);
   hitloc := atoi(s3);

   if (grpno == MSG_TYPE_SPELL)
   {
      if ((s2 == SPL_FINGER_DEATH))
      {
          act("Your scarabaeus lights up as it protects your life force.");
          power := -1;
          block;
      }
   }
   ...

<b><i>A note upon activating a DIL program</i></b>

This is what you can't do:

  If a DIL program is already active, e.g. it is sending a message or
  perhaps using "exec" to perform an action, then it can not be activated.
  Thus, any active DIL program is unable to catch further messages.
  Imagine this setting:

  You have five program P1..P5. P1 sends a message, which is intercepted
  by P2. P2 now sends a message, but since P1 is busy it can not process
  the message. P3..P5 are however possible candidates.
  Assume P3 sends a message, and P4 acts upon it. P4 now sends a message
  and the ONLY program which can catch it is P5, since all the other programs
  are "busy". If P5 sends a message no-one can act upon it. When P5
  returns, so does P4, P3, P2 and finally P1.

<b>on <i>n</i> goto <i>la</i>, <i>lb</i>, ..., <i>ln</i>:</b><a name="ongoto">

    This construct is an easy way of performing a goto operation
    based on the result of an integer. The integer value 'n' must
    be zero or positive and less than the number of labels specified
    in the label-list. If n is outside this range, the on-goto operation
    is skipped and execution continues at the next instruction.

    Based on the value of 'n' execution continues at the label
    corresponding to number 'n' in the list. I.e. if n is 0, then
    execution continues at the first specified label, if n is 1
    then at the second, etc. etc.


<b>Example:</b>

  Assume you have an integer 'i' larger than zero, which takes
  on 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Based on each value you need to take a
  different action, this is how you can do it:
<i>
    on i goto grin, laugh, grin, nada, poke, laugh;
    log("Value was not in the range 0..5");
    quit;

      :laugh:
      exec("grin", self);

<hr><b>foreach:</b><a name="forea">
  Foreach is an easy way to process all the units in the
  local environment relative to the 'self' executing the
  foreach. Foreach takes care of creating a list of local
  units, and of securing them. You can use both break and
  continue in a foreach statement. The unit executing the
  foreach ('self') is always a part of the foreach.

      It is important to understand that the units in the local
      environment are relative to the 'self' executing the foreach.

<b>Example:</b>
    This foreach is copied onto the spell caster, and hence all units
    relative to the spell caster (i.e. self) are processed in the foreach.
    Assume that it was executed on the spell caster's staff, then all units
    found would be relative to the staff, i.e. the spell caster's inventory.

<b>Assignment:</b>
    You can assign values to the variables you declare

<b>Expressions:</b>
  The expressions used in assignment can return any

  fail or null. An expression returning fail will not result
  in any action being taken. Fail is returned when you
  request a field from a null pointer, or the like.

<b>Operators:</b>

  DIL features many other operators. For integers,
  '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '!=' '==' signify less than,
  greater than, less or equal, greater or equal, not equal,
  and equality operators. Furthermore, you can compare
  strings with '==' or '$=' for equality test, and '!='
  for non equality. Pointers may also use '==' and '!='
  and you may force DIL to compare pointers, even for
  strings with the '#=' pointer-equality operator.
  The '$=' and '#=' is considered obsolete, and only
  used for backward compatibility.

<b>in:</b>
	The special operator 'in' is a multipurpose operator for
	a lot of things. It allows you to search through
	quests and extra descriptions, stringlists and search
	for words in strings.

<hr><a name ="esins">
string 'in' string
   Argument 1: A string to find.
   Argument 2: A string to search.
   Return: TRUE, if first string is found in second string.

<b>Example:</b>

  <i>dilbegin foo();
  code
  {
    if ("guard" in activator.title)
      exec("say hello guard",self);
    pause;
  }
  dilend</i>
</PRE><PRE>
<hr><a name ="esinsl">
string 'in' stringlist
   Argument 1: A string to find.
   Argument 2: A stringlist to search.
   Returns: 1.. if first string is found in stringlist, or 0 if it is
            non existent. If found the number equals the index of the
            string found plus one.

Example 1:
  s := "c";
  sl := {"a","b","c","d"};
  i := s in sl;

  The result of 'i' is 3, and sl.[i-1] equals "c" (s).

Example 2:

  <i>dilbegin foo();
  code
  {
    if ("james" in activator.names)
      exec("say hello james.",self);

   Return: Extraptr to first entry with string matching .names or
           null if none. (names must be exact letter by letter
           match, although case is ignored).

<b>Example:</b>

  <i>dilbegin foo();

<h3>Functions:</h3>
  DIL features an extended set of built-in functions
  for extended program control. Built-in functions can be part of
  any expression in DIL. The built-in functions are
  listed later.

<b>Example:</b>

  <i>dilbegin foo();
  code
  {
    exec("say I exist in "+itoa(self.loaded)+"copies", self);
    pause;
  }
  dilend</i>

  DIL also lets you use templates as functions, but in a
  limited way. Using templates as functions, you may only
  use the return value to assign it to one of the variables
  declared in the 'var' section. No fields.

<b>Example:</b>

  <i>dilbegin integer bar(s:string);
  code
  {
    exec("say "+s,self);
    return rnd(1,10);
  }
  dilend</i>

  <i>dilbegin foo();
  external
    integer bar(s:string);
  var
    myint:integer;
  code
  {
    myint := bar("rolling the dice.");
    exec("say I rolled a "+itoa(myint));
    pause;
  }
  dilend</i>

<hr><a name="fquit">
quit:
  This simple command quits the entire DIL program, even if
  called while inside a procedure or function.

<hr><a name="fret">
return:
  Return from a call to a procedure template (no return type
  declared). The execution continues from where the procedure
  was called.

<hr>
return():<a name="fret2">
  Return from a call to a function (return type declared).
  The expression inside the parenthesis evaluates to the value
  returned.

<hr>
  DIL also allows for game-time *symbolic* resolving of
  function/procedure names. This allows you to pass template names
  as string arguments and call them in your program. This kind of
  function call requires taxing look ups and type check runtime, so
  use the normal kind of procedures if possible.

  In effect, the syntax of a symbolic call is similar to that of
  a normal, except you use a string variable as function name
  instead of the real function name. If the string variable contains
  a valid reference to a procedure/function, and all the argument
  types matches the found templates argument types, the call
  is made. Otherwise, the call is skipped. Note that you will get no
  type check by the compiler when using symbolic references.

<IMG SRC="../images/backgr/waveline.gif" BORDER="0"  HEIGHT="18" WIDTH="100%"><br><a name ="fields">
<h3><b>Fields:</b></h3>
</PRE><PRE>
The 'extraptr' and 'unitptr' types contain information which is available to
you by using fields. For example (self is a unitptr), self.inside is a
unitptr to what is inside the 'self' unit. (Hence '.inside' is the field).
And self.inside.outside is a unitptr to self (assuming that something is
actually inside self, otherwise self.inside would evaluate to null).
Some fields may not be changed by DIL programs directly but must be modified
indirectly using certain procedure calls in DIL. Others may not be changed
at all. All are readable for DIL programs.

The extraptr structure is used for several things. The primary is
extra descriptions for units, and quest data. Keywords in the 'names'
field and the actual description/data in the 'descr' field.

In the following (RW) means the value may be assigned new values by DIL,
while (RO) means the the value only can be read. A (RO) value might be
possible to change through built-in functions/procedures
<hr>
<b>The extraptr has the following fields:</b><a name ="extra">

   extraptr:
      'names'        :stringlist (RW)

<P>restore loads a copy of a unit or units which were previously saved with the
'store' command. Just as with "load", the unit is put inside the unit which
executes the restore command unless the 'u' argument is not null.  If the 'u'
argument is an unitptr like room, object, npc, or pc the items restored will be
placed inside the 'u' Unit..
<P><B>Note</B>, It is only possible to restore items as long as the main-database
contains a reference for the unit 'name@zone'.  Use 'Store' and 'Restore'
sparingly, remember that items saved in player's inventories are automatically
saved in this instance.
<P>The 'store' and 'restore' are perfect for operations such as mud mailing
objects from player to player, storage devices for players that will keep
inventory through a reboot.  Even the ability to save a players inventory while
they fight in an arena and restore it to them undamaged when finished.  Finally
it could be used to save a donation room through reboots since it can be used on
a room to store the contents of a room any NPC or objects in the room would be
saved through reboot.
<P><B>Disk access is always slow</B>.
If you use 'Restore' on a continuous basis always attempt to keep file sizes to
a minimum for quick loading.  Otherwise you might cause serious delays on the
server.  If the Dil that uses Restore saves at certain times try to make it so
the saves are spread out over as large amounts of time as possible.

integer command ( cmd : string or integer )

         Alternatively you can specify one of the macros defined in

 return: Whether the command specified by the activator is the one of

It is noteworthy, that unlike simple compares like this;

	if ("spook" in cmdstr) {
	...
	...
	}
or
	if (cmdstr == "spook") {
	...
	...
	}

where the first will activate even if the cmdstr is "nospook", and the
second only if cmdstr equals the word "spook" to the letter, the
following construct will activate as long as the contents
of cmdstr doesn't conflict with cmd;

	if (command("spook")) {
	...
	...
	}

ie, it will receive the same kind of treatment as a 'regular' command.
That means that you provide ease of use to the user (allowing shorthand
notation), while securing that you're doing what the user wants.
<a name="bfcommand373"><STRONG>CAVEAT</STRONG> Builder:
If you use a string argument as cmd, be sure that
there are no white-space in it, ie, that the argument does only
consist of letters.

Example:
    command("spook");

    is a valid string, while this construct;

    command("spook him");

    is NOT valid. The reason of that is that cmdstr only contains the
    FIRST word of the input from the player, and thus the latter
    construct could never evaluate to true. This should be evident
    taking the above information into account, as "spook him" could
    never equal "spook" (which would indeed be the text in cmdstr
    if the player entered the string "spook him".)

unitptr findunit ( u : unitptr , s : string , i : integer , l : unitptr )
     u : The unit the local environment is relative to.
     s : A string with name of the unit to find.
     i : The environment, where to look for it, see FIND_UNIT_*
         in values.h and/or vme.h.
     l : An optional list of units to search.
 return: If the unit is found, the function returns that unit.
          Returns null if nothing found.

  The first argument is typically the char that's looking for something,
  i.e. if Mary needs a spoon to stir the pot, she'll be the first argument.

  The second argument is what you're looking for, represented by a string.
  In the above mentioned example, that'd be "spoon".

  For the second or third argument, you have a choice, as you'll only need to
  use one of them, and let the other be 0 or null.  For instance, if you have
  a pointer to Mary's kitchen utensil pot, you can use the line:

     findunit(mary, "spoon", 0, pot);

  Or you can just let her look around for it with:

     findunit(mary, "spoon", FIND_UNIT_INVEN or FIND_UNIT_SURRO, null);

  You can use all the FIND_UNIT_ values defined in values.h and/or vme.h, if you
  want to look for something for example within the zone (FIND_UNIT_ZONE), the
  entire world (FIND_UNIT_WORLD) (you rarely need to do that, it's mainly for
  tell etc.), or just the inventory or equipment of the char in question
  (FIND_UNIT_INVEN and FIND_UNIT_EQUIP).  Finally, as in the example above,
  you can look in the room of the char (FIND_UNIT_SURRO).

  Using FIND_UNIT_PAY or FIND_UNIT_NOPAY in this function will be ignored.
  <P>
The flags for findunit, intuitively:
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_EQUIP:<BR>
  The objects you will see with `equipment'
  Assumes first argument to findunit is a char.
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_INVEN:<BR>
  The objects you will see with `inventory' or `look in bag'
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_SURRO:<BR>
  The objects you can see, and get with `get',
  or the characters you can `poke' :-)
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_ZONE:
  As FIND_UNIT_WORLD, only more local.
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_WORLD:
  Any object in the entire world.  Does NOT start looking close to the 
  object of findunit's first argument, but rather somewhat randomly.
</P>
<P>
On top of these, the following (new) values are defined:
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_IN_ME:<BR>
  Anything inside of the object of the first argument.
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_HERE:<BR>
  Anything `here', i.e. in object or around it (same as IN_ME + SURRO)
</P>
<P>
FIND_UNIT_GLOBAL:
  ANYTHING, starting close to object and working out.

unitptr findrndunit( u : unitptr, sv : integer, uf : integer)
   Returns: A pointer to a random unit, or null
   u  : The unit pointer which the search is relative to.
   sv : The search-location, a value (not bit vector) of FIND_UNIT_XXX
   uf : Bit vector. The unit flags which can match of UNIT_ST_XXX

   Example: u := findrndunit(self, FIND_UNIT_ZONE, UNIT_ST_PC|UNIT_ST_NPC);

   This routine returns a random unit. Notice how the 'uf' lets you
   specify exactly what unit types to look for. The 'sv' is not a
   bit vector, although FIND_UNIT_XXX is usually used as such. If
   you need to search multiple environments, then call the routine
   once for each.

   Using FIND_UNIT_PAY or FIND_UNIT_NOPAY in this function will
   pick a random player which in addition to being in the search
   environment also is registered as valid payer (or not). Asking
   for a room would yield a random room registered to be accessible
   for paying players only (or not). Asking for objects would
   return no unit (null).

unitptr findsymbolic ( s : string )
   s : Symbolic name of the NPC or Object to find.
   return: A pointer to an instance of the unit, or null.
   Example: findsymbolic("bread@midgaard")

   This routine supplements findroom and findunit. It comes in handy,if it is
   important to get a correct reference to a NPC in the world.  If for example,
   Mary needs to send a message to John the Lumberjack,  then she should NOT
   use the findunit() since it may locate a different John - even a player!
   If she instead locates him using findsymbolic("john@haon_dor") she will be
   certain that it is in fact her husband, and not the player John Dow from
   Norway.  It will NOT locate rooms, for the only reason that findroom is a
   lot more efficient.


unitptr findsymbolic ( u : unitptr, s : string, i : integer )
   u : Search is relative to this unit.
   s : Symbolic name of the NPC or Object to find.
   i : FIND_UNIT_XXX bit vector of places to search.
   return: A pointer to an instance of the unit, or null.
   Example: findsymbolic(self, "bread@midgaard", FIND_UNIT_INVEN)

   This routine supplements findroom, findunit and findsymbolic(#).  It comes in
   handy, if it is important to get a correct reference to a unit somewhere
   relative to 'u'.  If for example, Mary needs to check if she has her own
   cooking pot, then she should NOT use the findunit since it may locate a
   different pot, not belonging to Haon-Dor but to some other zone.  If she
   instead locates it using findsymbolic(self, "pot@haon_dor", FIND_UNIT_IN_ME)
   she would be certain that it is in fact her own cooking pot that she is
   carrying around, and not some other pot from a Joe Blow's zone.

  'exec()'. The inline procedures are used as any other procedure by typing its
  name, followed by a list of argument expression enclosed in parentheses. The
  return types of the expressions used for built-in procedure calls are checked
  by the compiler.

    DIL also lets you call templates defined in the current or other zones.  The
  naming of templates follows the normal naming convention for zone, using the
  'name@zone' as a symbolic name for a procedure.  Before being able to use
  external procedures, you must define their name and type in a separate
  'external' section in the template.  The declaration in the 'external' section
  should match the original declaration of the referenced program. You can define
  the number and type of arguments the template take, by listing them inside the
  declaration parenthesis (as well as in the original declaration of that template)
  (see example below)
</PRE><PRE>
<b>Example:</b>

  <i>dilbegin bar(s:string);
  code
  {
    exec("say "+s,self);
    return;
  }
  dilend</i>

  <i>dilbegin foo();
  external
    someproc@hades1();
    bar(s:string);
  code
  {
    someproc@hades1();
    bar("Hello "+activator.name);
    pause;
  }
  dilend</i>
</PRE><PRE>
    When the procedure is called, the argument expressions are calculated, and
   passed to the template.  Built-in procedures, their arguments and function
   are listed later.

    The following are definitions and documentation for the built-in procedures
   in DIL. The definitions are not definitions 'as such', but serve to distinguish
   arguments in the documentation below.

<DT><B>container</B><DD><P>Do you want to save the container 'TRUE' for yes, 'False' for no
</DL>
</PRE><PRE>
<P>Store saves a copy of a unit or units.  If the container value is 'TRUE'
everything inside  including the container itself will be saved. If the container
argument is 'FALSE' only the contents of the object will be saved.  You will want
to use the 'TRUE' value when saving something like a Clan chest that has items
inside to store and has extras on the chest that you also wish to keep.  The
'FALSE' value for container would be good for temporary storage of PC inventory
or for storing room contents.
</PRE><PRE>

<P>The 'store' and 'restore' are perfect for operations such as
mud mailing objects from player to player, storage devices for players that will
keep inventory through a reboot.  Even the ability to save a players inventory
while they fight in an arena and restore it to them undamaged when finished.
Finally it could be used to save a donation room through reboots since it can be
used on a room to store the contents of a room any NPC or objects in the room
would be saved through reboot.
</PRE><PRE>

<P><B>Disk access is always slow</B>.
If you use store on a continues basis, it is essential that you do so ONLY if it
is needed and even then, only at amply spaced intervals.  Otherwise you might
cause serious delays on the server.  Remember that items saved in player's
inventories are automatically saved in their instance.

<hr>
<h3>Syntax:</h3>
<P>
act(message, visibility, char, medium, victim, to_whom);
<dl>
	<dt>message
		<dd> - is a string that will be shown to other mobiles when the act is executed.
		To refer to the following arguments use the <A href="#formatters">formatters</a> listed below.
	<dt>visibility
		<dd> - is an integer that defines what happens if the mobile that is about to receive the
		message can't see the activator.
		<dl>
			<dt><CODE>A_SOMEONE</CODE>
		<dd>If the receiver cannot see char, replace any reference to char with
	   <samp>someone</samp>.
	  <dt><CODE>A_HIDEINV</CODE>
	<dd>If the receiver cannot see char, don't send the message at all.	Use
	    this when missing vision should eliminate the perception of the action
		the message represent. One instance where it is used is in smile. You
		would need a ridiculously sensitive ear to hear, let alone percept
		that someone's smiling if you can't see them. Do not use it if
		'sound' is inherent in the message.

	<dt><CODE>A_ALWAYS</CODE>

	<dt>char

		   the message.
	<dt>medium
		<dd> - is a unit pointer, an integer or a string. Use this at your
		       leasure.
	<dt>victim
		<dd> - is a unit pointer, an integer or a string. Certain flags in
		       the next argument rely on the validity of victim.
	<dt>
		<dd> - is an integer that defines who gets the message.
		<dl>
			<dt><CODE>TO_ROOM</CODE>
				<dd>Sends the message to the entire room, excluding 'char'.
			<dt><CODE>TO_VICT</CODE>

			<dt><CODE>TO_NOTVICT</CODE>
				<dd>Sends the message to the entire room, excluding 'char'
				    and 'victim'.  Perfect for bystanders in a melee.
			<dt><CODE>TO_CHAR</CODE>

<h3>
<a name="formatters">Act Formatters</h3>

Just as the description formatters, act has its own set of formatters that
enable you to create generic messages that will be interpreted at run-time,
lessening the load on you.

The format string is a normal message, containing some special characters:<BR>
<dl>
  <dt>'$$'
  <dd>will be sent to the receiver as a single `$'
  <dt>'$', followed by a number and an extra character.
  <dl><h4>The numbers:</h4>
      <dt>'1'
      <dd> means this formatter refers to the 'char' argument.
      <dt>'2'
      <dd>means this formatter refers to the 'medium' argument.
      <dt>'3'
      <dd> means this formatter refers to the 'victim' argument.
   </dl>
   <dl><h4>The characters</h4>
      <dt>'N'
      <dd> the formatter will be replaced with the name of the unit, or
	       (depending on the visibility)
		   'something' or 'someone'.
      <dt>'a' 
      <dd>'a' or 'an' depending on the name of the unit referred by the number.
      <dt>'e'
      <dd>'it', 'he' or 'she' depending on the gender of the unit referred
	       by the number.
      <dt>'m'
      <dd>'it', 'him' or 'her' depending on the gender of the unit referred by
	       the number.
      <dt>'n'
      <dd> the formatter will be replaced with the title of the unit, or
	       (depending on the visibility) 'something' or 'someone'.
      <dt>'p'
      <dd>'fighting', 'standing', 'sleeping', etc., depending on the position
	       of the unit referred by the number.
      <dt>'s'
      <dd>'its', 'his' or 'her' depending on the gender of the unit referred
	       by the number.
      <dt>'t'
      <dd>the string in the argument referred by the number.

exec ( s : string , u : unitptr )
   s : Command and arguments to perform.
   u : Unit to perform command.
   result: Unit (PC/NPC) executes command. The argument is treated just as
           if a normal PC entered a command at the command prompt in the
           game. It is not directly possible to detect whether the command
           was a success or fail. For example, you might force a PC to
           "get key". If there is no 'key' available, the PC will get
           notified the normal way. Plenty of examples are given above.

<hr><a name="bpwait">
wait ( i : integer , dilexp )
   i : Message class to accept, see SFB_* in values.h and/or vme.h
   dilexp : Expression that has to be TRUE or not null to accept message.
   result: Waits for a command, matching the flagset, and satisfies the
           expression. When using the 'wait()' command, the first argument
           is an integer, that tells what classes of messages to wait for.
           Each message class is represented by a bit named as described in
           the chapter on messages.
<b>Example:</b>

   wait (SFB_TICK|SFB_MSG, TRUE)
   /* Will accept a message, either from another DIL program or a
      timer message. As the second argument is always TRUE, any
      such message will reactivate the DIL program.
    */

<b>Example:</b>

  wait (SFB_CMD, command("transmutate"))
  /* waits for an command entered named 'transmutate'.
     Activates the DIL program, that then can block the command, or
     let it pass (and then let the game produce the normal error
     message for unknown commands).

   result: Blocks any command issued by a player or mobile. Blocking a
           command prevents the command from being parsed by the
           interpreter. This is ideal if you need to make a routine
           which intercepts a command, reacts on it in a special way,
           and does not need the standard way of reacting.

  u : the unit on which you wish to alter the current combat speed.

  Beware, this is not the 'speed' as in the speed field, rather this is
  the speed which is calculated during combat. It is used for spells like
  'stun' which effectively puts the character out of combat for one
  round. Such a spell would be implemented like:

   change_speed(u, 12)

  and would only cause any effect if 'u' was fighting already (if not,
  use setfighting).

   Returns: TRUE is money was transferred, FALSE if could not afford.

   If 'f' is null and 't' isn't, then money is created and given to 't'.
   If 'f' isn't null but 't' is, then money is removed from 'f'.

integer interrupt( flags : integer, dilexp, label )

   Set up interrupt matching message classes matching "flags",
   for example "SFB_COM" or "SFB_COM | SFB_MSG".

   When the program is activated on either of the specified conditions
   the 'dilexp' is evaluated. If true, then execution continues at 'label',
   otherwise the next interrupt is checked (if any).

   Interrupts are saved (restored), when 'recall' is set.
   Returns an integer which is used for clear() to clear an interrupt.

<b>Example:</b>

The following program shows, that the owner (self) of the program keeps
snoring while sleeping. The on_activation ensures that the program
is only activated when the owner is sleeping. However, since the interrupt
precede the on_activation, these may still be intercepted before the
on_activation. The on_activation is just another type of interrupt that
reacts on all flags (without actually setting them so that the program
is activated).

When the program receives the message "relief" the snoring stops briefly.
As used, "relief" may only be set once.

When the program receives the message "cured", the snoring stops completely
(i.e. the program quits itself).

<i>dilbegin

var
   i : integer;

code
{
  /* Notice that the sequence in which the interrupts (and the on_activation)
    are executed, is quite important: You can be cured at *any* time. The
    program will skip if you are not sleeping. If you are sleeping you can
    be relieved. */

   interrupt(SFB_MSG, argument == "cured", the_end);

   on_activation(self.position != POSITION_SLEEPING, skip);

   i1 := interrupt(SFB_MSG, argument == "relief", relief);

   :loop:
   exec("snore", self);
   pause;
   goto loop;

   :relief:
   /* Suppose you can only be relieved once, then we must clear interrupt */
   clear(i1);
   pause;
   pause;
   goto loop;

   :the_end:
   /* Person is cured... */
   quit;
}
dilend</i>

<hr><a name="bpclear">
clear( i : integer )

   Clears the interrupt number "i". If i is invalid, this will either
   clear an wrong interrupt or do nothing.

<hr><a name="bpona">
integer on_activation ( dilexp , label )
   dilexp  : A boolean DIL expression.
   label   : Label to jump to - OR the reserved keyword SKIP.
   returns : The index to the interrupt handing the on_activation.

   result: Sets up an interrupt that is executed before every activation
           of the DIL program. This is for example useful to catch
           situations where your NPC has fallen asleep or is injured.
           If 'dilexp' evaluates to TRUE then the program jumps to 'label'.
           If 'label' is 'skip' then the program is simply not activated.
           When the on_activation evaluates to true, and jumps to a label
           other than skip, the condition is automatically cleared. If the
           dilexp evaluates to false, or if the label is skip, the activation
           remains active. Use the clear() to remove the on_activation.

   <b>Example:</b>
           on_activation(self.position <= POSITION_SLEEPING, skip);
             or
           on_activation(self.position > POSITION_SLEEPING, let_me_sleep);
