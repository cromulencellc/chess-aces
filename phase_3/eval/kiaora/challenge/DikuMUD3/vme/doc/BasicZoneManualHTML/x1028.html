>The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> language is the language a builder can use to make his own
special functions on rooms, NPCs, objects, PCs, and much more.  This
manual is for basic zone writing and therefore will not go into how to
write your own <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> functions.  The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> however is released with many
functions for you as an Administrator and your builders to use to make
special rooms, NPCs, and objects.  The following is a list of all room
functions released with the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> 2.0 server.</P

>Death room</DT
><DD
><P
></P
><P
>This function is a simple function that allows you to create a
room to do damage to a player. The death_room can kill them slowly like
a fire cave would or it can kill them quickly as if you stuck them in a
microwave it is all up to how you set the arguments.  It also lets you
see the acts the players see so this function can be used on any number
of death style rooms.  There is no need to understand how the function
works just how to use it so with that in mind the following is the
functions header.</P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;//In function.zon
dilbegin death_room(tick: integer, damage: integer, act_s: string);&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>As with any function all you have to do is 'dilcopy' the function
onto your room with the correct zone name and arguments and it will do
the rest.  In this <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> you have three arguments to pass The first is the
'tick' or time which in this <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is broken down into 'ticks' which are 4
ticks per second.  Thus if you wanted to get something to do damage
every minute you would put '60*4' in that spot.  The next is the amount
of damage you want done per your time.  If for example you want '60' hit
+points damage done each round you just put '60' as that argument. 
Finally is the act shown to the character as a string in quotes.  So a
finished death room on your room would look like this.</P

>Climb</DT
><DD
><P
></P
><P
>     This special <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> is used for the climb skill and should be set on
     stationary objects (stationary mast, robe, tree, wall, etc). The
     'difficulty' is the skill-amount required to climb. A skill of 100
     would be a 50% chance for the expert thief / climber. The 'damage'
     is how much damage is given if you fail to climb the object. When
     you fail, you "fall" to the 'destination', so you can make gravity
     work correctly. The destination can be the same room in which you
     started but it doesn't have to be. The 'direction' is the direction
     in which you want the person to have to climb enclosed in quotes.</P

>We should note here, if you wanted the person to have to climb
back down you will need to put a climb <ACRONYM

> on the room you are climbing
too that has the "down" directory as an argument.  This <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM

you to link two rooms not linked by normal directions but we
suggest you should think before doing this because it may not make sense to not
have a link between the two places.</P

><P
>The 'tick' parameter is how fast you want the force move to be
triggered.  The 'tick' is in 1/4 second increments so to get a one
second wait you would place a four.  The second parameter is two strings
the first being the symbolic name of the room you are forcing the
character to.  The second string is the act you want shown to the player
or NPC when it is moved.  The final parameter is either a one or a zero.
The one stands for true and it would make the timer trigger randomly
fifty percent of the time, while a zero would make it not random.</P
