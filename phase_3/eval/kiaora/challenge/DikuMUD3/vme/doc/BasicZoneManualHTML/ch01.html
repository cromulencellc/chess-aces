>In order to get your zone onto a valhalla Mud Engine (<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
>) server you must convert your zone from readable
english text to binary form the server can understand.  The way
you do this is with a compiler.  No don't freak out you don't have
to be a skilled programmer to use a compiler.  The only thing you
have to do is format your rooms, objects, and Non-player characters
(NPC) in a form which the compiler can understand.  The great thing
about the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> is you can do all your zone writing in your favorite
editor with out having to log on to code.  For those of you who have
coded for other mud servers and are used to coding online this may
be a new experience to you but you will find you can plan out
better and more well designed areas offline than you can on
line.</P

for <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

> servers.  A compiler takes a source file or better described
as your areas input file and converts it to a binary file the
server can then load and use online.  In the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> we call areas
you build 'zones', therefore the source file for a zone has the
extension 'zon'.  In order to make this more clear we will start
with our first example.</P
><P
>Lets say you were making a Zone of dragons.  You may want to
call the file something resembling its contents like,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dragon.zon</TT
>.  Notice we have appended the
'.zon' extension.  The compiler requires all zones to end in '.zon'
in order for it to know this is a zone source file.</P
><P
>Now lets say we have completed writing our first zone and want
to compile it.  The command is simply:
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VMC&#62; dragon.zon</B
>
If the zone compiles correctly it will indicate success by printing
a message to the screen and outputting two files both with the same
root name as the original zone source file but with different
extensions.  In this case there would be the following:
<P
></P

>dragon.data</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>The file holding the binary version of the zone</P
></DD
><DT
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dragon.reset</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>The file containing the reset information for the
zone.</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
>
If the zone doesn't compile correctly and you have errors it
will print a list of the errors and the location where they can be
found so you can fix them.  The debugging process will be explained
more as you learn how to create rooms, monsters, and objects.</P
