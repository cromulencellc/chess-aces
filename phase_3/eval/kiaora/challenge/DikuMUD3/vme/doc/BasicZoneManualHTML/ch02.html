>Chapter 3. Zone source file</H1
><P
>In this chapter we will define all the sections of a zone file
and go in-depth on the zone info section.  Once complete with this
chapter you should be able to create an empty yet compilable zone.</P
><P
>A zone source file is split up into 6 sections.  A
zone-declaration section, a mobile (NPC) section, an object
section, a room section, a reset section, and the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
>
section.  The zone section is the only section that  has to be in the file, and
they may appear in any order.</P
><P
>Each section is preceded by a section header. These are the  six
possible headers:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>%zone</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>%rooms</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>%mobiles</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>%objects</P

><LI
><P
>%reset</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>%<ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
></P
></LI
></UL
>
The  first  four sections may be considered lists of definitions.
The reset section can be considered a program in a simple  programming
language. And the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> section is a bit special - it
includes the zone templates (DIL functions that can be used from any
zone, on anything, as opposed to "specialized" DIL functions placed
inside a unit's
definitions).  After all sections you are using are defined you
must tell the compiler you are done the special symbol '%end'
must be placed at the end of the zone for this reason.</P

>3.1. Definition types</A
></H1
><P
>When creating your zone there are six main building blocks.
We call these definition types.  Each type represents some kind of
data you want the compiler to be able to recognize.  These data
definitions take the basic form:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN262"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;field value&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>Where field is the name of a data field, and value is some value.
Values are of one of 6 types:
<P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>integer</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
A whole number or if you are in practice of using Hex you can
use the C style hex numbers in either upper or lower case (i.e 0X0f3
0x0f3)</P
></DD
><DT
>string</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
						Text enclosed in Double Quotes.  The string can span more than
one line
as it would in a description.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P

><A
NAME="AEN278"

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;title "The dark dragon altar"

"There are many things you can see and there are many things that 
can't be seen but this is still a description none the less."&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
></DD
><DT
>stringlist</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
A set of strings, it can be a single string or multiple depending on your needs.
These are used in names, extras, creators, and special keywords all to be
defined later in their respective places.  These are defined in the following
manor.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN286"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;&lt;fieldname&gt;    {"string1","string2","string3", ...}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
></DD
><DT
>intlist</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
A list of numbers which can be used with an extra.  This type works like the
stringlist but doesn't need the quotes.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN294"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;extra {"mynumberlist"} {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...}
"This is a number list attached to an extra"&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
></DD
><DT
>flags</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
Like the Intlist the flag is defined with a list of numbers.  The list of numbers
is not taken literally however it is combined to create one number by binary
oring the number list together.  If that confuses you don't worry, it
takes some getting used to.  These types are used for Manipulation, flags,
and positions.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN302"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;flags {2,8}
manipulate {8}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>In the previous example the 'flags' value after this zone compiles
would be 10 because binary oring the two flags together is a lot
like adding.  The two numbers probably make no sense so most flags
you use will have defines if I used the defines found in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vme.h</TT
> the previous example would look like this:</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN306"
></A
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;flags {UNIT_FL_INVISIBILE,UNIT_FL_BURIED}
manipulate {WEAR_BODY}&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>We will cover this more in-depth later but it was necessary to give
a good overview so you understand this field type enough to recognize
what it is when you see it.</P
></DD
><DT
>symbol</DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;
A label you reference from other parts in your zones.  Every
unit (room,object,room) and even the zone itself has a unique label
that can be referenced.  It is important to make symbol names that
are clear so the Administrators of the mud know what each item
is when using the online administration commands.</P
><DIV
CLASS="INFORMALEXAMPLE"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN315"

><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;dark_sword /*good symbol*/
rm_5892 /*Bad symbol*/&#13;</PRE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>When loading items online the zone symbol and the item symbol are
combined to create a reference to the item.  For example if our zone
name was 'dragon' and our item was 'dark_sword' the symbolic name for
this item would be 'dark_sword@dragon'.  Using symbols will be
covered more in the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
> manual and in the administration manuals for
loading objects online.  For now it is enough to understand 
symbols must follow the following rules when being defined.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The first letter of the
symbol must be a letter of the alphabet or a '_' character</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Characters following the first can be numbers, alphabet
letters, and '_' characters</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The name can be no longer than
15 characters</P

>The Structure field types are  a combination of other field types
to make a special field type for the unit being defined.  A good example
of this is a 'exit' for a room.  The exit has everything from flag,
string, stringlist, and even description fields.  The exit field will be
defined much more in-depth in the chapter on rooms but it is important
to know some fields are considered Structure fields because they can have
many values.  The only two Structure fields are the exit and extra
fields which will both be defined more later because they can be used
differently depending on what you are using them for.</P
