not always have exactly the same use when coding rooms, NPCs, and
objects but they are normally set in the same manor.  It is very

 The important thing to realize with the object symbol is it is always
 good practice to give the object a symbol that resembles the title and
 description so administrators and builders can use the
 <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>load</B
> and the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

 locate, examine, and load the object in question. </P

><P
>The object title is what is shown if the object is being picked
up, dropped, given to someone, when you do the inventory command, , or being used in combat.
there should be no punctuation in the object title
because of how it is used in the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VME</ACRONYM
> server.  If you add punctuation or
forget to capitalize something that the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>VMC</ACRONYM

give you a warning when you compile. The following are good examples of
an object title.</P

>The object names are as important as the NPC names.  They are what
you act on when picking the object up, dropping it, throwing it, just
about anything you do to objects use these name fields.  On drink
containers you add the liquid name at the end, so people can drink the liquid.  You
always need to make sure you put every possible name that the player may
use to examine or take your item.  The rule of thumb is if it is in the
title or description it should be in the names list.  conversely if it is
not in the title or description it shouldn't be in the names list
because the players will not use it if they don't know about it.</P

number but it would not be easy to understand.  For example 5 gold
pieces would be something like:</P

follows:</P

amount of each coin you want on the NPC.  If you set it using a single
integer the compiler would pick how many of each coin.  This of course
is not what is desired in fact you want to be able to set your cost
however you like.  So setting more than one coin is as simple as adding
a comma between the first and second coin.</P
