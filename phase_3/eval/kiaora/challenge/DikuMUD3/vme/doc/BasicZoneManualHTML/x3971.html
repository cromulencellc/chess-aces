<A
HREF="x2061.html"

things and then compile to make finding errors easy.  In this case we
have one object to compile and rather than having all the rooms and NPCS 
get in my way while compiling it I have removed them and only have the
'%objects' section.  The following is what the zone looks like when it
has only one object in it.</P

there are errors in it.</P

always fix the smallest numbered error first.  In this case the lowest
numbered error shows up in line five of the zone.  The error says
something is wrong with the '{' but looking at the line it is obvious
the compiler got confused because I forgot 's' at the end of 'creators'.
 If we fix line five and recompile this is what we get:</P

>Now we have come to another one of those weird errors.  If you
look at line 25 you will find that the line looks like it is correct. 
As we have said before when you find an error like this it most likely
means that you are missing a quote or a '{}'.  The only way to find the
problem is start at the quote or '{}' before the word in the error and
go backwards through the file till you find a missing one.  Lucky for us
the missing one is in the very next string.  If you add a double quote
just before the ending comma on line 24 and recompile you will get the
following:</P

><P
>This error is a little tricky.  It seems to be pointing at the ','
as the problem.  If you look at the line though and remember what you
need for a manipulate field you will notice that the surrounding '{}' are
missing.  The reason the compiler is pointing at the comma is because it
doesn't understand what to do with the comma with out the '{}' grouping
symbols.  Fixing these and recompiling results in the following message
from the compiler.</P

you have now successfully compiled the zone.  This is the last debugging
walk through in the manual.  If you still have a lot of trouble figuring
out errors don't stress compiling is an art the more you do it the
easier it will get.  We suggest you take the zones we have provided in
our release and create errors so you can get used to the messages
you will see when you are making your own zones.  Never be afraid to
ask for help from someone else sometimes a bug is so simple you will
over look it and sometimes it just takes a second person a single glance
to find it.  Another trick to finding errors if you have been looking
for more than 5 minutes take a break and come back in 10 minutes
sometimes that short relaxing time will help you find the
problem.</P

>You have now compiled your first object.  The steps are the same
to get it into the game as it was for the rooms and NPCs.  We will not
go over them again except to say copy your files that the compiler made
over into the zone directory of your mud and reboot.  From there log on
and you should be able to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>wstat</B
> and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>load</B
> your object by using its full symbolic
name.  It would be a good idea to try and get this zone into your server
and lay with the object a bit so when you get to <A
HREF="x4362.html"
>Section 7.6</A
> you will be ready for anything.</P
