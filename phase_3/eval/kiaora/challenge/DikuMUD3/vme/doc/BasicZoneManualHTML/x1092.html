section we will build on what you already know to allow you to make much
more fancy rooms.  IN this section we will give a much better view of
the exits and what can be done with them including doors, hidden doors and
rooms inside other rooms.  We will also show some examples of the room

add the doors reset to the '%reset' section.  The door resets will be
explained in <A

we have a direction both in the room you are going to and the room you
came from.  This means you need a 'west' direction for every 'east'
direction leading to it.  If you do not put both you will end up with a
one way direction.</P
