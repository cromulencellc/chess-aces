>The zone information section is the only section that must
exist in the source file of your area.  With out this section the
compiler is unable to create the zone because frankly it doesn't
know what to call it.  It is also the easiest of the sections to
learn because there is only a few possible fields. The  Zone-section  defines  the global parameters for the current
zone. It is usually wise to place this section in the top of  the
source file to make it easy to find the zone information when editing the file.</P

field gives the condition that must be met to reset the zones you

RESET_IFEMPTY, and RESET_ANYHOW.  Default is RESET_ANYHOW, which
means, the zone will be reset even if players are present within it.</TD

><TD
> This is the title of the zone, for example Dragons Nest, Dark
station, and
creators hide out.  It is used mainly for the areas command so
players can get a list of all the areas in the game.  It can
however be accessed by the 'zoneptr' variable type in <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DIL</ACRONYM
>.  If you
have
a zone that spans across multiple source files you only need to
define the title once.  If you put the title in all source files it
will show up multiple times in the area listing.  You would also
leave this blank if the zone should not be on the areas list like an
administration zone.</TD

>This field sets the humidity level of the zone.  If for example you want
a hot desert like zone you would want to set this to its highest value. 
The range of this field is 1000 to -1000.  This is an optional field and
will not be covered else where because it is simple to use.</TD

after the %zone tag, which should always be put, even if you
do not add a symbol after it.</TD

>The only field that must exist when you go to create the zone
information section is the '%zone'.  Leaving the '%zone' field out
will cause an error when you try to compile it.  We suggest you
not only put the '%zone' field but you also add a symbol or as I
call it a zone name.  The following are three legal examples of a Zone information header.  You be the judge of
which is more informative.</P

>If you felt like it you could add a '%end' to the proceeding
examples and compile them.  They would create an empty zone so
wouldn't be very exciting but at least its possible.  We will not go into any compiling until we have at least one unit
type to compile because it is pretty useless to do.
   the next chapters will
define the basic unit building blocks you will use for rooms,
objects, and NPCs and start you off on compiling.</P
