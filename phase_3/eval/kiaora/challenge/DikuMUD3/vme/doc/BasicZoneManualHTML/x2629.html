more interesting	g.</P

either cast fire breath or acid breath depending on who you talk to. 
Once you learn <ACRONYM

spell but for now we will stick with what we know.  I like the acts of
the acid breath spell so we will use that as the spell of choice.  The

>Field 1</DT
><DD
><P
>   Field 1 is the guild level. It is simply the level at which one is
allowed to practice the particular entity in the guild. A level of 0
indicates that one can practice it from the beginning.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 2</DT
><DD
><P
>This is the maximum percentage one is allowed to practice the
particular entity. It can be anywhere from 1 to 200. For abilities, it
should be in increments of 2 (or divisible by 2), and for spells, skills,
or weapons, in increments of 5 (or divisible by 5). This means that the
effective minimum depends on whether the entity is an ability or a spell,
skill or weapon.</P
><P
>Therefore, the minimums for abilities is 2, and the minimum for spells,
skills or weapons is 5. Anything less will be automatically practiced to
the effective minimum. This also means that putting an odd number for
abilities will result in the player practicing an additional point, and
for spells, skills or weapons, practicing up to the nearest 5.</P
><P
>For example:    Percentage maximum for an ability is set for 95%. Player practices the
ability, which then becomes 96%.
   Player then decides to practice a weapon skill. It is set to 77% maximum.
After practicing, the player has 80% in the weapon.
   It is better to simply make the ability 96% and the weapon 80% maximum
instead.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 3</DT
><DD
><P
>Name of Entity</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 4</DT
><DD
><P
>This is the practice cost minimum in Old gold pieces. Anything less than 10 here
will simply be translated as 1 iron piece. Anything other than a number divisible
by 10 is rounded up to the nearest iron piece.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 5</DT
><DD
><P
>This is the practice cost maximum in old gold pieces. It is generally defined as
being 1000 times what Field 4 is defined as:</P
><P
>The reason for this is because there is a scale related to the current
practice percentage of the entity. The practice minimum is what the entity
costs when it is at 0%, and the practice maximum is what it costs to
practice it to maximum percentage.</P
><P
>It is not necessary to multiply the minimum by 1000 to define the
maximum. It can be any number, as long as the maximum exceeds the minimum.
Failure to do so will result in the mud crashing. It is unknown what will
happen if the fields have 0 entered in them. I warn that it could be rather
unpredictable.</P
><P
>Setting the maximum too high will only serve to dissuade players from
practicing and indeed even playing. This is not to say you cannot make a
truly powerful entity very expensive. Just make sure that the entity is
worth the cost.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 6</DT
><DD
><P
>This is the only necessary practice points field. It allows one to use
their skill or ability practice points to increase their character's powers.
This number is generally determined by the desire of the builder to make
the entity easier or harder to practice, based upon the logical
consideration of how this class would learn/use the entity.</P
><P
>For instance, a Fighter class would find practicing "fist" to be
exceedingly easy, so they may only need 4 points to practice this skill, 
but on the other hand, a Mage class would not have such an experience so
it may cost them 15 points to practice.</P
><P
>Don't go overboard, making this field an outrageous number will mean
that no one is likely to practice the entity, mainly because of lack of
points. However, like in the cost fields, it can be made expensive to
reflect the power of the entity.</P
></DD
><DT
>Field 7 - X</DT
><DD
><P
>You can repeat field 6 as many times as you want the player to be
able to practice in one level so you can set a point cost each
time.  This is so each time they practice at a level you can make it
more expensive.</P
