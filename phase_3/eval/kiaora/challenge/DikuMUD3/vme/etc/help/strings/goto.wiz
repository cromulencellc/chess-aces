Usage:<br/>
   &gt;goto &lt;unit&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the wizards way of travelling. At an instant, you can move across<br/>
the worlds. You will appear in the same room, as the unit you specify, thus<br/>
making 'goto papi' take you to the same room as papi, 'goto cup' take<br/>
you to the same room as a cup (but only if the cup is in a room!)and <br/>
'goto inn@udgaard' will take you to that specific room.<br/><br/>
