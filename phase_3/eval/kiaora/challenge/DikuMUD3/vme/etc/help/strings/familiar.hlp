A familiar is acquired through a couple of different guild paths.  Naming one<br/>
inappropriately will cost you the ability to own a familiar, so name them<br/>
wisely and weigh the odds. Is the name you chose questionable? Is it named<br/>
after player or mob? These are just a few examples of bad familiar names.<br/>
USE COMMON SENCE!!! If you have none refrain from owning a familiar and<br/>
save you and admin some grief!<br/>
