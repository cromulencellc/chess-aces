Usage cast summon water<br/><br/>
<br/>
This spell will summon a water elemental to fight for you in combat. It can<br/>
only remain on this plane for a short time, and when killed returns to its<br/>
home plane of existence. Due to the difficulty in summoning these creatures,<br/>
only one can be controlled at once and they cannot be commanded to cast<br/>
spells.<br/>
