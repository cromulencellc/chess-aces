Spear Family<br/>
<br/>
The spear family is composed of the spear proper; the long spear,<br/>
or pike; the spectum; the ranseur; and the partisan. All weapons in this<br/>
class are basically daggers atop a sturdy pole, with trimmings added to<br/>
make the weapon more efficient in one way or another. <br/>
