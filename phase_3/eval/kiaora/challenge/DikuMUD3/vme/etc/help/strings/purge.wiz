Usage:<br/>
   &gt;purge [&lt;unit&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
This wiz-command enables you to completely remove any unit from the world. Even<br/>
if a player is in the menu-system, you can remove him. The command is rather<br/>
violent, and just kick any player off. Only one limit is set, you may not purge<br/>
rooms. With no argument, you purge everything but players at the location.<br/>
