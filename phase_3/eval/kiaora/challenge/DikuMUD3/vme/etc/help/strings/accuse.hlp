<div class="mw-parser-output"><h1>Accuse</h1>
<p>When you see a player commit a crime the following text should be displayed:
</p>
<pre> You have just witnessed a crime committed by &lt;playername&gt;
</pre>
<p>At this point you may chose to ignore it or be an upstanding citizen
and go to the local city guard office. Here you can accuse a player of any
crime you may have witnessed him committing. There you would for example
use:
</p>
<pre> accuse Quinn of murder
 accuse Zadran stealing
</pre>
