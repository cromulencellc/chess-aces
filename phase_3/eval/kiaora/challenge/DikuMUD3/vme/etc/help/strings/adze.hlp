<p>Average Length: Approx. 2' to 5' feet
</p><p>The adze was a traditional carpenter's tool with a long thin
axe-like blade attached at a right angle to the handle; they
were used for cutting grooves. The Maori of New Zealand used
adzes (called a Toki) as war weapons. Theirs were carved of
bone or jade, usually decorated very elaborately, and lashed
to a wooden handle.
