Another favorite with merchants, wanderers, and thieves, this weapon had<br/>
many titles. It usually consisted of a long narrow piece of wood, sometimes<br/>
with a spike mounted on the end. It was good for defense and could attack<br/>
reasonably well, and was also useful as a walking stick.<br/>
