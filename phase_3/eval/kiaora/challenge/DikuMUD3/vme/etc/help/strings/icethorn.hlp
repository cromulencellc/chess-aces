Usage: cast ice thorn<br/>
No true Druid need ever be without a weapon with this spell, which lets<br/>
the caster focus the elements of ice into a magical dagger.  The dagger<br/>
will be stronger and more durable depending on the skill of the caster.  As<br/>
time passes, however, the dagger will eventually melt away.<br/>
