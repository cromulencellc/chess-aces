<br/><br/>The maiden name can be anything not only your mothers maiden name. 
This will only be used if you lose your password so make sure it is
something you will never forget.  Do not share your maiden name with
anyone because anyone having this can request the Admin to change your
password, in afect giving the character to them. If you leave this blank 
and lose your password, there is no way Admin will be able to set a new
one so you will lose use of that char and any items they may pocess.<br/>
