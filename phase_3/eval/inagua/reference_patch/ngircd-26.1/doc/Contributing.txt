If you want to contribute to ngIRCd, please read the following paragraphs to
get an idea of how to do it the best :-)

 - Use GIT

   The source code of ngIRCd is maintained using GIT, see doc/GIT.txt. So if
   remotely possible, use GIT for your work, too. It makes your and our lives
   much easier ;-)

 - Don't forget to include documentation

   When adding features and new configuration options, don't forget to not
   only code the features but to describe them in doc/sample-ngircd.conf,
   man/ngircd.8.tmp and/or man/ngircd.conf.5.tmpl as well!

 - Be present on IRC

   If you intend to code some new features or do some code cleanups or better
   documentation, please be present on <irc://irc.barton.de/#ngircd> and
   discuss your plans early! So other developers have an idea on what others
   are working on, can offer help, and can synchronize their own work.

 - Check and validate your work!

   Use "make check" to validate your work, and use "make distcheck" to
   validate the resulting archives, especially when adding/removing files!

 - Send patches in "unified diff" format

   Please send patches in "unified" format, that is, use "diff -u".
   Or even better: use GIT ("git diff"), see above.

 - Send patches to the mailing list

   If you have some code to present, send the patch(es) and/or pointers to
   your GIT repository to the official ngIRCd mailing list for review, not
   only to #ngircd: so it becomes archived and more people have a chance to
   review your patch.

   Sure it is a good idea to post some notes to #ngircd, too! :-)

   And this is open source, your work must not be 100% finished and perfect,
   work in progress is interesting, too: "release early, release often"!

- Use GitHub to create "Pull Requests"

  ngIRCd is hosted on GitHub (<https://github.com/ngircd>), so please use the
  tools available there and open issues (comment!) and create pull requests!
  See <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/> for details.
