This document lists and describes the "IRC capabilities" that ngIRCd supports
and can be requested by a IRC/IRCv3 client that supports the "CAP" command.

ngIRCd implements the "IRC Client Capabilities Extension" as described here:
<http://ircv3.net/specs/core/capability-negotiation-3.1.html>


I. Supported Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* "multi-prefix"

   When requested, the multi-prefix client capability will cause the IRC
   server to send all possible prefixes which apply to a user in NAMES and
   WHO output.

   See <http://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multi-prefix-3.1.html>.
