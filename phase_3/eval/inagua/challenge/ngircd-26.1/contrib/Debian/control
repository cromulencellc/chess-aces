Description: lightweight Internet Relay Chat server
 ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat server
 for small or private networks, developed under the GNU General Public
 License (GPL).
 .
 The server is quite easy to configure, can handle dynamic IP addresses, and
 optionally supports IDENT, IPv6 connections, SSL-protected links, and PAM for
 user authentication as well as character set conversion for legacy clients. The
 server has been written from scratch and is not based on the "forefather", the
 daemon of IRCNet.
 .
 This package contains the "standard distribution", including support for
 syslog logging and compressed server-links using zlib. Please have a look
 at the "ngircd-full" package if you need "more advanced" functionality like
 support for TCP wrappers, IDENT requests, the IPv6 protocol, PAM and
 SSL encrypted client and server links.
