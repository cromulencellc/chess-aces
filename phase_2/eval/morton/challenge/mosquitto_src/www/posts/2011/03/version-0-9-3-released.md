This is a bugfix release:

 * Set retained message status for QoS 2 messages (bug #726535).
 * Only abort with an error when opening listening sockets if no address family is available, rather than aborting when any address family is not available.
 * Don't clean queued messages when a non clean session client reconnects.
 * Make mosquitto.py compatible with Python &lt;2.6.
 * Fix mosquitto.h header includes for Windows.
