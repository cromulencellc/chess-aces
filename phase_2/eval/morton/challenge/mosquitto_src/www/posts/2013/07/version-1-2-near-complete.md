With the most recent commit, "Implement TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.1 support,"
everything that is planned for version 1.2 has been completed. If you haven't
tried it out yet, now would be a good time to take a look.

Before the release is finalised, there still needs to be more testing done,
particularly on Windows. If you use another platform than Windows or Linux, I'd
be interested to hear if you have any problems with the 1.2 code. I will also
be updating the packaging for all of the binaries that I build or contribute to
directly, so there is still time for bug reports.

You can get a copy of the source at one of the links below, or through the
mercurial repository directly on the 1.2 branch.
