The mosquitto project has, or can get, access to a wide variety of different
systems to help with development. One important platform for which this is not
true is Mac OS X. There are sufficient differences between Macs and other
systems that this makes life difficult.

To this end, I would like to reach out to the mosquitto community to ask for
help with obtaining either

 * A remote login on a Mac system
 * Donation of hardware
 * Donation of money to buy some hardware

I have been offered a remote account by a few individuals in the past, for
which I'm very grateful, but only on a short term basis and, understandably,
with limited control. Something on a longer term, with the ability to install
packages would be much more useful. Unfortunately I realise this is relatively
difficult to offer.

On the hardware side of things, there isn't a need for a modern, powerful
computer. A second hand Mac Mini of Core2Duo vintage with 1GB RAM and a
reasonably modern version of Mac OS X would be quite sufficient, and ideal for
me in terms of the space it takes up. Regrettably I feel I would have to turn
down offers of an old iMac or Mac Pro.

2007-era Mac Minis go on Ebay UK for around £100. I'm hopeful that there is a
company out there using mosquitto, likes Macs and for whom £100 would be a drop
in the ocean. If so, or any individuals want to help out with a small donation
towards this, please get in touch directly to roger@atchoo.org or head over to
the downloads page to see the paypal donation link, and thanks very much in
advance.

Update:

I have now awaiting delivery of a Mac mini. Thanks very much to all of you that
have contributed, it is very much appreciated. If you would still like to
support mosquitto development please don't let this put you
off...
