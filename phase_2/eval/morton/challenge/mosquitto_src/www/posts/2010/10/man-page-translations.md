Something that is very much in the back of my mind whilst developing mosquitto
is that it should have support for language translations. I've been reluctant
to start this effort until development was a little bit more settled, to avoid
wasting translators time. I think it's now time to start the ball rolling.

I'm going to approach this in two stages - the man pages and the programs. Man
pages are first. I've imported the translation templates to launchpad, so if
your native tongue is anything other than English and you'd like to translate
them - please go ahead. I'll be putting any translated man pages (with credits
:) into the upcoming 0.9 release. I think I've finished making changes but if I
haven't, the one most likely to change is for mosquitto.conf

The translation page can be found at <http://translations.launchpad.net/mosquitto/trunk>

Thanks in advance, and please get in touch if you find any strings that don't
make sense.
