STOP!  If you are reporting a security issue, which includes *anything* that
       may cause the broker/client to crash, please do NOT report it here but
       follow the steps at https://www.eclipse.org/security/

If your issue is not a bug or a feature request, please use the mailing list at
https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/mosquitto-dev to ask your question.
There are many more people available to help there than on this issue tracker.

If you are reporting a bug PLEASE include the version of Mosquitto you are
using and what platform (Windows, Ubuntu/Fedora/... Linux, FreeBSD, ...) you
are running on.

Please also note that some systems have old versions of Mosquitto available in
their package repositories. We would be very grateful if you would check to
see whether the bug is still present in a newer version before submitting your
issue.
