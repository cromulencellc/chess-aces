To celebrate the new mosquitto logo, stickers are now available:

[![stickers](/blog/uploads/2016/05/stickers-300x225.jpg)](/blog/uploads/2016/05/stickers.jpg)

If you would like to obtain some stickers for yourself you have two options.

The first is to get in touch and I'll send you some for a small contribution.
This contribution is to cover the cost of the stickers plus postage: (cost of
postage)+N\*£0.45, where N is the number of sheets of 6 stickers that you want.
Cost of postage for a letter can be calculated using the [Royal Mail price
finder], but should be £1.05 for destinations outside of the UK. Please also
consider Paypal fees using a [fees calculator] to calculate the final sum. So
for a single sheet of stickers posted internationally, the cost would be £1.76
including paypal fees. Two sheets would be £2.23.

The second option is to buy a full sticker book through moo.com. This can be
done very easily by navigating to <http://mosquitto.org/stickers/> This
allows you to easily order a sticker book of 90 stickers with either the colour
or blue monochrome stickers, or a mix of both.

There is a third option - get in touch to say why you deserve some stickers and
maybe we'll send you some. We're looking for things that make us say "wow!" If
you will be sending your sticker to space, getting mosquitto on television or
using MQTT in your Formula 1 technology, these are all things that would
exciting to see with a mosquitto sticker in place. If you want to give out
stickers at a local IoT related event or similar that's great, but we'd ask
that you make a small donation. It's only a small cost for you, but there are
many people in your situation and it becomes a noticeable cost for the project.

Please do post links of your kit sporting any stickers you use!
