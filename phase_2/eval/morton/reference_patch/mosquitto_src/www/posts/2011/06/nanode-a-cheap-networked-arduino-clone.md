The arduino, the open source microcontroller board, has had MQTT support for a
long time in the form of [Nick O'Leary's arduino client]. It does however
require networking support which has traditionally provided by an add on
shield, which increases the cost of the system.

The [Nanode] is an arduino compatible board which includes network support and
can be built for approximately the same cost as a normal arduino board. It's
still a work in progress, but is definitely worth a look if you want to use low
power MQTT capable sensors/controllers.
