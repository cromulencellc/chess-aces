 and
shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord
of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to
its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this
natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the
hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest
secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.[20]

 [20] The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
 unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
 gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
 one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
 Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
 curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
 themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious
 parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s
 pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk
 is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
 with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
 salute _more hominum_.

And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.

Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles, was nothing to what at la
