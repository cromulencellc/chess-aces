ce, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.

SICILIAN SAILOR.
(_Reclining._)
Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet interlacings of the limbs—lithe
swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing
touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan?
(_Nudging._)

TAHITAN SAILOR.
(_Reclining on a mat._)
Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low
veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft
soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first
day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor
I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear
I the roaring streams from Pirohitee’s peak of spears, when they leap
down the crags and drown the villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine,
and meet it! (_Leaps to his feet._)

PORTUGUESE SAILOR.
How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand by for reefing,
hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they’ll go
lunging presently.

DANISH SAILOR.
Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest! Well
done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more afraid than
the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must
always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a
pistol—fire your ship right into it!

ENGLISH SAILOR.
Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the lads to hunt him
up his whale!

ALL.
Aye! aye!

OLD MANX SAILOR.
How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live
when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none but the crew’s
cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when
brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain
has his birth-mark; look yonder, boys, there’s another in the
sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

DAGGOO.
What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m quarried out of
it!

SPANISH SAILOR.
(_Aside._) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes me touchy.
(_Advancing._) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of
mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.

DAGGOO (_grimly_).
None.

ST. JAGO’S SAILOR.
That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or else in his one
case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in working.

5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.

SPANISH SAILOR.
No; Daggoo showing his teeth.

DAGGOO (_springing_).
Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!

SPANISH SAILOR (_meeting him_).
Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!

ALL.
A row! a row! a row!

TASHTEGO (_with a whiff_).
A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and men—both brawlers! Humph!

BELFAST SAILOR.
A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge in with ye!

ENGLISH SAILOR.
Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!

OLD MANX SAILOR.
Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain struck Abel.
Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st thou the ring?

MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef topsails!

ALL.
The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (_They scatter._)

PIP (_shrinking under the windlass_).
Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay!
Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard! It’s
worse
