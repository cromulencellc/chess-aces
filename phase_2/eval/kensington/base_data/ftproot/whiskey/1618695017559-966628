hearts as light,
    To love, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim,
    And break on the lips while meeting.

A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,
just through with this job—coming.




CHAPTER XL. MIDNIGHT, FORECASTLE


HARPOONERS AND SAILORS.
(_Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,
and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus._)

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
    Our captain’s commanded.—

1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the digestion! Take a
tonic, follow me!

(_Sings, and all follow._)
Our captain stood upon the deck,
    A spy-glass in his hand,
A viewing of those gallant whales
    That blew at every strand.
Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
    And by your braces stand,
And we’ll have one of those fine whales,
    Hand, boys, over hand!
So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!

MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
Eight bells there, forward!

2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the
bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I’ve
the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So, so, (_thrusts his
head down the scuttle_,) Star—bo—l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there
below! Tumble up!

DUTCH SAILOR.
Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our
old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as filliping to
others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail ’em through
it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em it’s the
resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That’s
the way—that’s it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating Amsterdam
butter.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket
Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip!
little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP.
(_Sulky and sleepy._)
Don’t know where it is.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry’s the
word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and
gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! Legs!

ICELAND SAILOR.
I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my taste. I’m used
to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the subject; but excuse
me.

MALTESE SAILOR.
Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take his left hand by
his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners! I must have
partners!

SICILIAN SAILOR.
Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea, turn grasshopper!

LONG-ISLAND SAILOR.
Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us. Hoe corn when you
may, I say. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now
for it!

AZORE SAILOR.
(_Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle._)
Here you are, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,
boys!

(_The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep
or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty._)

AZORE SAILOR.
(_Dancing._)
Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it,
bell-boy; Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!

PIP.
Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.

CHINA SAILOR.
Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! split jibs!
tear yourselves!

TASHTEGO.
(_Quietly smoking._)
That’s a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.

OLD MANX SAILOR.
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing
over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the bitterest threat of
your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to
think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well;
belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so ’tis
right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you’re young; I was
once.

3D NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm—give
us a whiff, Tash.

(_They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky
darkens—the wind rises._)

LASCAR SAILOR.
By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide
Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!

MALTESE SAILOR.
(_Reclining and shaking his cap._)
It’s the waves—the snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake t
