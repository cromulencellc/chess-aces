€ lighting from the boat to the deck, â€œthus I trample on thee,
thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and
destroy thee!â€

As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfâ€”these passed over the
mute, motionless Parseeâ€™s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
shouted outâ€”â€œTo the braces! Up helm!â€”square in!â€

In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed.

Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequodâ€™s
tumultuous way, and Ahabâ€™s also, as he went lurching along the deck.

â€œI have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!â€

â€œAye,â€ cried Stubb, â€œbut sea-coal ashesâ€”mind ye that, Mr.
Starbuckâ€”sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab
mutter, â€˜Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of
mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.â€™ And damn me, Ahab,
but thou actest right; live in the game, and die it!â€




CHAPTER CXIX. THE CANDLES


Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most
effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in
these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that
cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport.

Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted
to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahabâ€™s) did
not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
shipâ€™s high tetering side, stove in the boatâ€™s bottom at the stern, and
left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.

â€œBad work, bad work!â€ Mr. Starbuck, said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
â€œbut the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, canâ€™t fight it. You
see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,
all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But
never mind; itâ€™s all in fun: so the old song says;â€â€”(_sings_.)

Oh! jolly is the gale,
And a joker is the whale,
Aâ€™ flourishinâ€™ his tail,â€”
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean,
oh!

The scud all a flyinâ€™,
Thatâ€™s his flip only foaminâ€™;
When he stirs in the spicinâ€™,â€”
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean,
oh!

Thunder splits the ships,
But he only smacks his lips,
A tastinâ€™ of this flip,â€”
Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean,
oh!

â€œAvast Stubb,â€ cried Starbuck, â€œlet the Typhoon sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
thy peace.â€

â€œBut I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
Starbuck, thereâ€™s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat. And when thatâ€™s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a
wind-up.â€

â€œMadman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.â€

â€œWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
mind how foolish?â€

â€œHere!â€ cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow, â€œmarkest thou not that the gale comes
from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the
very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to standâ€”his
stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
must!â€

â€œI donâ€™t half understand ye: whatâ€™s in the wind?â€

â€œYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
Nantucket,â€ soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubbâ€™s
question. â€œThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homewardâ€”I see it lightens up
there; but not with the lightning.â€

At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€

â€œOld Thunder!â€ said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire.

Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
vesselâ€™s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
shipâ€™s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.

â€œThe rods! the rods!â€ cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. â€œAre they overboard? drop them
over, fore and aft. Quick!â€

â€œAvast!â€ cried Ahab; â€œletâ€™s have fair play here, though we be the
weaker side. Yet Iâ€™ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let
them be, sir.â€

â€œLook aloft!â€ cried Starbuck. â€œThe corpusants! the corpusants!â€

All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

â€œBlast the boat! let it go!â€ cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. â€œBlast it!â€â€”but slipping
backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
immediately shifting his tone, he criedâ€”â€œThe corpusants have mercy on
us all!â€

To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
f
