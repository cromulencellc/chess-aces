/*
 * Creates a DNS reply.
 *
 * The reply will be based on an existing query message `msg`.
 * The query body will be appended to the output buffer.
 * "reply + recursion allowed" will be added to the message flags and the
 * message's num_answers will be set to 0.
 *
 * Answer records can be appended with `mg_dns_send_reply` or by lower
 * level function defined in the DNS API.
 *
 * In order to send a reply use `mg_dns_send_reply`.
 * It's possible to use a connection's send buffer as reply buffer,
 * and it will work for both UDP and TCP connections.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```c
 * reply = mg_dns_create_reply(&nc->send_mbuf, msg);
 * for (i = 0; i < msg->num_questions; i++) {
 *   rr = &msg->questions[i];
 *   if (rr->rtype == MG_DNS_A_RECORD) {
 *     mg_dns_reply_record(&reply, rr, 3600, &dummy_ip_addr, 4);
 *   }
 * }
 * mg_dns_send_reply(nc, &reply);
 * ```
