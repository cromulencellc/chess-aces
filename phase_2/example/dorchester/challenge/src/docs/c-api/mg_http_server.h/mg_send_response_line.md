Sends the response status line.
If `extra_headers` is not NULL, then `extra_headers` are also sent
after the response line. `extra_headers` must NOT end end with new line.
Example:

     mg_send_response_line(nc, 200, "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");

Will result in:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n
